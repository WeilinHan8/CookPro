0,How to Freeze Bananas,"Peel the banana(s) and cut them into ½-inch thick slices. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lay the banana slices on the lined baking sheet in a single layer. Freezing the bananas individually first helps prevent them from sticking together in one large clump when frozen. Freeze the bananas for 1-2 hours, or until solid, then transfer to an air-tight, freezer-safe container, like a freezer bag, glass meal prep container, or glass jar. Label the container with the contents and date. For best results, use within three months.",1 brown banana; parchment paper; baking sheet; freezer safe containers

3,Larb Gai (Chicken Larb),"Roast 2 cups dried bird chiles, pulla chiles, or chiles de árbol, stemmed in a dry wok over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until they turn a deep, dark crimson (almost brown) and give off a sweet and earthy smell (not burnt). The process shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes, but it pays to be vigilant in making sure they toast evenly and slowly. Remove from heat and let sit until cool enough to handle. Transfer to a food processor, blender, or spice grinder and grind until slightly finer than the crushed red pepper you’d find at a pizza shop. Be careful not to breathe in any chile dust when you remove the lid. Do Ahead: Roasted chile powder can be made 3 months ahead. Store in a sealed container in a cool, dry place. Cook 1 cup uncooked glutinous rice or jasmine rice in a dry wok over medium heat, stirring occasionally at first, then more frequently as it browns. Once you smell the toasting rice, stir in 1¼"" piece fresh galangal, cut into thin coins, 1 Tbsp. thinly sliced lemongrass, and 2 makrut (Thai) lime leaves. Continue to cook until rice develops a deep amber golden hue, about the same color as brown rice, 15–20 minutes. Let cool. Transfer rice mixture to a food processor or spice grinder and pulse until mixture is the consistency of granulated sugar. Do Ahead: Toasted rice powder can be made 1 month ahead. Store in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Place ¾ lb. ground chicken in a small saucepan and cover with water. Cook over medium heat, stirring, until chicken is opaque but still soft. Using a spatula or spoon, break meat into small clumps. Drain off water, then stir in 3 Tbsp. fish sauce and 1 tsp. sugar until sugar is dissolved. Let cool. Add seasonings, in this order, giving a quick toss after each addition: 1½ Tbsp. Roasted Chile Powder, ½ cup thinly sliced (root to stem) red onion or shallots, ¼ cup thinly sliced green onions, 12 mint leaves, torn, ½ cup coarsely chopped cilantro leaves with tender stems, and 2 Tbsp. fresh lime juice.

4,Avocado Caesar Green Beans,"Make the Avocado Caesar: Blitz everything in a small blender jar until smooth sauce / dressing forms. Taste and adjust (look out, it’s really good). If it’s too thick, add some extra water until it drizzles smoothly off the end of a spoon. Make the Panko Crispies: Mix panko, garlic powder, olive oil, and salt in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30 second increments, stirring after each one, until the panko starts to turn golden (about 2-3 minutes total). It’ll be very hot – be careful, don’t taste it yet. Cook the Green Beans: Boil green beans for 3-5 minutes until bright green. If you want to preserve the best color, drain and transfer to a bowl with ice water to shock the green beans and stop them from cooking further. Not necessary, but I do this sometimes because I like the very bright green! Assemble and Serve: Arrange the green beans on a platter, top with dollops of the avocado caesar, and sprinkles of panko crispies and grated Parmesan. (You’ll probably have a little bit of avocado caesar left which I never have any issues using up!) Add lemon zest, black pepper, or chili flakes if you want. Serve warm or cold with your favorite protein, and maybe a little extra sauce for dunking. So good!","half an avocado; 1/4 cup mayonnaise ; 1/4 cup water (up to 1/2 cup); 1 large clove garlic; 1/2 tablespoon Dijon mustard; 2 tablespoons lemon juice; 1/2 teaspoon salt; 1 cup panko breadcrumbs ; 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder; 2 tablespoons olive oil; pinch of salt; 12 ounces green beans, ends trimmed; Parmesan for topping"
5,Lemony Asparagus Pasta,"Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add 1 lb. spaghetti and cook pasta, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain pasta, reserving 1½ cups pasta cooking water. Meanwhile, heat ⅔ cup extra-virgin olive oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high until shimmering. Add 1 large bunch asparagus, trimmed, thinly sliced on a deep diagonal, season with kosher salt, and cook, stirring often, until just beginning to take on color, about 1 minute. Add 4 garlic cloves, smashed, 4 (3""-long) strips lemon zest, and ½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat and let sit until pasta is done. Add cooked pasta and 8 large fresh basil leaves to pot with asparagus mixture and return to medium-high heat. Squeeze juice from 2 lemons, halved, into pot and add 2 oz. freshly grated Parmesan cheese (about 1 cup), and 1 cup reserved pasta cooking liquid. Cook, tossing vigorously and adding more pasta cooking liquid if needed, until sauce is creamy and emulsified and pasta is coated, about 1 minute. Taste and season with more salt if needed. Remove and discard garlic. Divide pasta among bowls, garnish each with a lemon strip, and top with more Parmesan cheese.

6,Your Best Grilled Burger,"Gather the ingredients. Heat a gas grill on high for 10 minutes with the lid closed or prepare a hot charcoal grill fire. Meanwhile, divide 1 1/3 pounds (21 ounces) cold ground beef (80 percent lean) into 4 equal portions and shape the meat into patties that are wider than your buns (the burgers will shrink a bit during grilling). If you have two deli lids, use those to form the patty. Otherwise, form the patties so there is a depression in the center with an approximately 1/2-inch wide rim around the edge. Handle the meat as little as possible. Season the burger patties with 1 1/2 teaspoons fine salt and 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper on both sides. When the grill is ready, place the burgers over direct heat and let sit without flipping or moving until nicely charred and the patties release easily from the grill grate, 4 to 5 minutes. The burgers should release easily from the grill. If you try to flip them and they’re sticking, wait another minute or so. Flip the burger patties and cook, undisturbed, for 4 to 5 minutes more or until cooked to your liking (use a thermometer if needed: the internal temperature should be 135 F for medium-rare burgers or 145 F for medium). In the last minute or so of cooking, place 4 sesame burger buns on the grill to toast and place 1 or 2 slices of the 4 to 8 slices American cheese, if using, on top of each burger patty to melt. Serve the burgers right away on the toasted buns with your choice of optional toppings: mayonnaise, leaf lettuce, sliced tomato, sliced onion, and/or pickles.","1 1/3 pounds (21 ounces) cold ground beef (80 percent lean); 1 1/2 teaspoons fine salt; 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper; 4 sesame burger buns; 4 to 8 slices American cheese, optional; Optional toppings: mayonnaise, leaf lettuce, sliced tomato, sliced onion, pickles"
7,Raspberry Bars with Oatmeal Cookie Crumble,"Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line an 8x8 inch pan with parchment paper and generously spray with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside. Make the base + topping: In a large bowl, use a fork to mix together the oat flour (or flour), oats, coconut or brown sugar, baking soda, salt and lemon zest, if using. Add in melted butter, vanilla extract and almond extract and stir until a nice crumble forms and dough begins to clump together. Place 1 3/4 cups of the mixture into the prepared pan and place the remaining mixture into the fridge (the remaining mixture will be used for the topping). Use your hands to evenly press the dough to the bottom of the pan. Next make your raspberry filling: place a medium pot over medium heat. Add in raspberries, maple syrup, vanilla extract, tapioca flour or arrowroot, lemon zest and juice, if using, and salt. Use a wooden spoon to press down and break down the raspberries just a bit. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 3-5 more minutes until mixture is thickened up and nicely coats the back of a wooden spoon. Pour mixture over the crust and use a spoon to spread evenly over the base. Take the remaining topping out of the fridge. By now there should be some nice crumbles that have clumped together. Sprinkle the topping over the filling. Bake for 30 minutes or until the filling is bubbly and the topping is golden. Allow bars to cool completely on a wire rack before transferring to the fridge to chill. Bars are delicious served at room temperature or straight out of the fridge. Use a sharp knife to cut into 12 or 16 bars before serving.","For the base + topping:; 1 1/2 cups gluten free oat flour (or sub all purpose flour or 1:1 gf all purpose flour); 1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats, gluten free if desired; 1/2 cup packed brown sugar (or sub coconut sugar but you may not get the best 'crumble'); ¼ teaspoon baking soda; ¼ teaspoon salt; Optional to make it lemon flavored: zest from 1 lemon; 8 tablespoons butter or vegan butter stick, melted; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract; ¼ teaspoon almond extract; For the raspberry filling:; 3 heaping cups fresh or frozen raspberries; 3 tablespoons pure maple syrup; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract; 1 tablespoon tapioca flour or arrowroot starch (can also use cornstarch); Optional to make the with a hint of lemon flavor: zest from 1 lemon and 1 tablespoon lemon juice; Pinch of salt"
8,"Roasted tomato, basil & parmesan quiche","To make the pastry, tip the flour and butter into a bowl, then rub together with your fingertips until completely mixed and crumbly. Add 2-4 tbsp water, or enough to bring everything together until just combined. Roll into a ball and use straight away or chill for up to 2 days. The pastry can also be frozen for up to a month. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to a round about 5cm larger than a 25cm tin. Use your rolling pin to lift it up, then drape over the tart case so there is an overhang of pastry on the sides. Using a small ball of pastry scraps, push the pastry into the corners of the tin. Chill in the fridge or freezer for 20 mins. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. In a small roasting tin, drizzle the tomatoes with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Put the tomatoes in a low shelf of the oven. Lightly prick the base of the tart with a fork, line the tart case with a large circle of greaseproof paper or foil, then fill with baking beans. Blind-bake the tart for 20 mins, remove the paper and beans, then continue to cook for 5-10 mins until biscuit brown. When you remove the tart case from the oven, take out the tomatoes, too. While the tart is cooking, beat the eggs in a large bowl. Gradually add the cream, then stir in the basil and season. When the case is ready, sprinkle half the cheese over the base, scatter over the tomatoes, pour over the cream mix, then finally scatter over the rest of the cheese. Bake for 20-25 mins until set and golden brown. Leave to cool in the case, trim the edges of the pastry, then remove from the tin. Scatter over the remaining basil and serve in slices.","300g cherry tomatoes; drizzle olive oil; 50g parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), grated ; 2 eggs; 284ml pot double cream; handful basil  leaves, shredded, plus a few small ones left whole for scattering; 280g plain flour, plus extra for dusting; 140g cold butter, cut into pieces"
9,Whipped Feta Dip,"To a bowl of a food processor or blender, add the block of feta cheese, Greek yogurt, sour cream, lemon juice, olive oil, and garlic. Blend the ingredients until smooth and creamy. Taste to adjust any of the ingredients to your preference. You may need to add salt if desired. Spoon the whipped feta dip out onto a serving bowl or plate. Use the back of the spoon to create swoops or swirls on the surface of the dip. Drizzle generously with the olive oil and top with red pepper flakes, parsley or mint, or your favorite toppings. Serve with crackers, toasted bread, pita chips or pita bread, or your favorite veggies."," 8 ounces feta cheese, 1 block;  1/2 cup Greek yogurt;  1/2 cup sour cream, or more greek yogurt;  2 Tablespoons lemon juice;  2 Tablespoons olive oil;  1 garlic clove, minced;  Aleppo red pepper flakes,chopped parsley or mint, for garnish;  Pita bread or crackers, for serving"
10,The Best Weeknight Pasta Sauce,"Add the ground beef and olive oil to a pot and sauté over medium until the beef is cooked through (about 5 minutes). If you’re using a higher fat content beef (10% or higher), you may want to drain the excess fat once the beef has browned. While the beef is cooking, finely dice the onion. Add the diced onion and butter to the cooked beef. Continue to sauté until the onion is soft and translucent (about 5 minutes). Next, add the crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning blend, and some freshly cracked pepper (10-15 cranks of a pepper mill). Stir everything to combine. Place a lid on the pot and allow it to come up to a simmer. Once simmering, reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for 30 minutes. After a minimum of 30 minutes simmering, add about 1/2 tsp salt, stir to combine, then taste and add more if needed. The flavor of the sauce will deepen and the complexities will pop once the salt is added. Serve over pasta or your favorite roasted vegetables.","1/2  lb. ground beef; 1 Tbsp  olive oil; 1 small onion; 2 Tbsp butter; 28 oz. crushed tomatoes; 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning blend; Freshly cracked pepper; Salt, to taste"
11,Curried Chickpea Couscous Salad,"Prepare the couscous: In a medium pot, add the water and salt and bring to a boil. Immediately stir in the couscous and return to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes until all of the liquid is absorbed. Transfer to a large sieve and rinse the couscous with cold water for about 1 minute, until couscous has cooled. Transfer to a large bowl. In the large bowl with the couscous, add in the chickpeas, shredded carrot, bell pepper, parsley, cilantro, onion, dates or cherries and mix of nuts. Prepare the dressing, then pour over salad and use tongs or a large spoon to toss the salad with the dressing until well coated. Taste and add extra salt and pepper, as necessary. To store: Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.","Couscous:; 1 ½ cups water; ½ teaspoon kosher salt; 1 cup pearl couscous*; For the salad:; 1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed; 1 large carrot, shredded; 1 red bell pepper, diced; ⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley; ⅓ cup chopped fresh cilantro; ¼ cup finely diced red onion; ½ cup chopped Medjool dates or dried tart cherries; ⅔ cup mix of toasted sliced almonds, roasted cashews and roasted pistachios (whatever mix of these nuts you have on hand is great!); Dressing:; 1 batch curry tahini dressing; Extra fresh ground salt and pepper, to taste"
12,Tahini Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Bites,"In a medium bowl, mix tahini and coconut oil together until smooth. Next stir in maple syrup and vanilla extract until well combined. Add in almond flour, 2 tablespoons coconut flour and salt and stir until a cookie dough consistency forms. Allow dough to sit for 5 minutes so that it thickens up. It should be doughy and moist but not overly wet; if it’s too wet add another ½ tablespoon of coconut flour. Stir in chocolate chips. Grab about a tablespoonful of dough and roll into a ball and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. You should get about 10 cookie dough balls. Freeze for 10-15 minutes. While the cookie dough is freezing, break chocolate up into chunks and place into a microwave safe bowl with coconut oil. Microwave on high in 30 second intervals until chocolate is melted and smooth. Alternatively you can melt in a small saucepan over low heat. Use a fork to dip each cookie dough ball into melted chocolate and stir to fully coat, then place cookie dough ball back on the baking sheet. You likely will not use all of the chocolate. Freeze again for 10 minutes, then take back out of the freezer and use a spoon to drizzle the cookie dough balls with remaining melted chocolate for a pretty look on top. Place back in freeze for 5 minutes, then enjoy! Makes 10.","½ cup (115g) drippy tahini; 2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted and cooled; 4 tablespoons pure maple syrup; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract; ½ cup (56g) packed fine blanched almond flour; 2-3 tablespoons coconut flour (start with 2); ¼ teaspoon salt; 3 tablespoons chocolate chips; For the dark chocolate coating:; 1 (3 ounce) 70% dark chocolate bar; 1 teaspoon coconut oil"
13,Honey Salmon with Ginger Scallion Sauce,"Prep the oven and baking sheet. Heat oven to 425°F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Prep the salmon. Place the salmon filets skin-side-down at the end of the prepared baking sheet. Whisk together the soy sauce and honey in a small bowl until combined, then brush it evenly on top of the salmon. Prep the green beans. Lay the green beans in a tight pile on the other end of the baking sheet and drizzle with the olive oil. Toss until evenly coated, then arrange the green beans in an even layer covering the rest of the baking sheet. Season the green beans and the salmon generously with salt and pepper. Roast. Bake for 10 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked to your liking. (I prefer to remove my salmon when the internal temperature measures 135°F, as it will continue to cook slightly more as it rests. Please note that cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of your salmon filets.) Transfer the pan to a wire cooling rack and drizzle the salmon and green beans with the juice of 1 lime. Make the ginger scallion sauce. Heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until tiny bubbles begin to form around the sides of the pan. (If you drop a scallion in the oil, it should sizzle vigorously.) While the oil is heating, combine the white parts of the scallions, ginger and garlic in a small heat-proof* (see note below) bowl or measuring cup. Once the oil is hot, very carefully pour it on top of the scallion mixture (it will sizzle and sputter!) and gently stir to combine. Add the soy sauce and the green parts of the scallions stir to combine. Taste and season with extra salt and pepper as needed. Serve. Serve the salmon and green beans over rice, topped with the ginger scallion sauce and served with extra lime wedges for squeezing, and enjoy!","4 salmon filets; 2 teaspoons soy sauce; 2 tablespoons honey; fine sea salt and freshly-ground black pepper; 1 tablespoon olive oil; 12 ounces French green beans; 2 limes; 4 cups cooked brown or white rice; 1/2 cup avocado oil (or another mild high-heat oil, such as sunflower, grapeseed, or vegetable oil); 6 scallions (~75 grams), thinly sliced; 2 tablespoons finely minced or grated fresh ginger; 2 cloves garlic, finely minced or grated; 1 tablespoon soy sauce"

Shape into a ball, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rest. Heat most of the vegetable oil in a pan over a medium heat and sauté the onion, garlic and ginger, stirring, for 6–8 minutes, until softening. With a slotted spoon, remove the onion mixture to a bowl and set aside.

21,Mixed Berry Crisp (Gluten Free),"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Rinse and drain the berries and pick through to remove any stems still attached. If you’re using strawberries, slice them into ¼-inch thick pieces. If you’re using particularly large blackberries, slice them in half. In a 9 by 9-inch baking dish, mix together the berries, honey, starch, citrus zest and juice. Set aside. In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the oats, almond meal/flour, sliced almonds (if using), sugar and salt. Mix in the butter and yogurt. Stir until all of the flour is incorporated and the mixture is moistened throughout. Dollop spoonfuls of the oat mixture over the filling and use your fingers to break up the mixture until it is evenly distributed (no need to pack it down). Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the filling is actively bubbling around the edges and the top is lightly golden. Let the crisp rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Serve with vanilla ice cream (I insist!).","Mixed berry filling; 2 pounds (32 ounces, about 5 cups) mixed berries, fresh or frozen*; ⅓ cup honey or maple syrup; 2 tablespoons arrowroot starch or 3 tablespoons cornstarch; ½ teaspoon orange or lemon zest (if you don’t love strong citrus flavor, scale back to ¼ teaspoon, or omit); 2 tablespoons orange or lemon juice; Gluten-free oat and almond topping; 1 cup old-fashioned oats**; ½ cup packed almond flour or almond meal; ½ cup sliced almonds or chopped pistachios or pecans (optional); ⅓ cup packed coconut sugar or brown sugar; ¼ teaspoon fine salt; 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted; 3 tablespoons plain yogurt (Greek or regular), or additional melted butter; Plus vanilla ice cream, for serving"
22,Cardamom Scones,"Prep the oven and baking sheet. Heat the oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Make the dough. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, baking powder and salt until evenly combined. Use a pastry cutter (or your fingers) to cut the butter into the dough until it resembles coarse cornmeal. Create a well in the center of the bowl, add the half and half, 1 egg and vanilla extract. Then use a fork to briefly whisk the wet ingredients together. Whisk the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until a dough begins to form. Use your hands to bring the dough together and knead the dough a few times until a ball can be formed. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Make the cardamom-cinnamon-sugar. In a separate bowl, whisk the cardamom, cinnamon and 2 tablespoons sugar together until combined. Layer the scones. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into a roughly 8×11-inch rectangle (the size of a sheet of paper). Sprinkle half of the cinnamon-sugar mixture over the dough and lightly press it down with your hands (see video), then fold the dough in half. Use the rolling pin to roll the dough out lightly into an 6×10-inch rectangle. Sprinkle the remaining cinnamon-sugar over the dough, then fold in half once more. Use your hands to lightly press down the dough to seal the edges, then shape the dough roughly into a 6-inch circle. Use a sharp knife to slice the dough into 6 pie wedges and transfer them to the prepared baking sheet. Top the scones. Whisk the egg white together with 1 tablespoon of water until lightly frothy. Brush the egg wash evenly over the tops of the scones to coat, then sprinkle the remaining sugar on top. Bake. Bake for 15 minutes or until the scones are slightly golden around the edges. Transfer to a wire baking rack to cool. Make the glaze. Meanwhile, whisk together the glaze ingredients until combined. (If it seems too thick, add in more liquid. If it’s too thin, add in more powdered sugar.) Once the scones have cooled to room temperature, drizzle them with the glaze. Serve. Serve immediately and enjoy!","1 3/4 cups (230 g) all-purpose flour; 1/3 cup granulated white sugar, divided; 1 tablespoon baking powder; 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt; 1/2 cup (8 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, diced; 1/3 cup half and half; 1 large egg + 1 egg white; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract; 2 teaspoons ground cardamom; 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon; 1/2 cup powdered sugar; 1 tablespoon half and half"

24,Banana Pudding Jars,"Stir together 1 Tbsp. dark brown sugar, 1 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice, 2 tsp. vanilla extract, and ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a medium bowl until sugar and salt are dissolved. Cut 5 medium ripe bananas, peeled, lengthwise into quarters, then cut into ¼""-thick pieces. Add to bowl and gently toss to coat (make sure all of the pieces get coated to prevent excess browning). Set banana mixture aside. Beat one 3.4-oz. box instant vanilla pudding and pie filling and 2 cups whole milk in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on medium speed until well combined, about 3 minutes. With motor running, add one 8-oz. package cream cheese, room temperature, about 2 oz. at a time, mixing until incorporated before adding more; beat until smooth, about 4 minutes total. Scrape pudding into a large piping bag without a tip. (Or, scrape into a large resealable plastic bag and snip off a corner.) Line up jars on counter. Working one at a time, spoon about 1 Tbsp. reserved banana mixture into each. Pipe a thin layer of pudding over, then top with 1 whole biscuit from one 7-oz. package Marie biscuits. (If jar is too small to fit a whole cookie, break into 2 or 3 pieces and layer in.) Repeat layering process, starting with banana mixture followed by pudding and biscuit and ending with a final layer of pudding, until pudding is used up. Crush any leftover biscuits and set aside for serving. Cover jars with lids and chill at least 2 hours. When ready to serve, uncover and top each pudding jar with whipped cream and reserved biscuits. Do Ahead: Pudding jars can be assembled 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.","1 Tbsp. dark brown sugar; 1 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice; 2 tsp. vanilla extract; ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp.

25,Ultimate Zucchini Bread,"Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly coat a 6-cup or 9×5-inch loaf pan with nonstick spray. Place grated zucchini in a large bowl and add oil, eggs, sugars, vanilla, and salt. Use a fork to mix until combined. Sprinkle cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, and baking powder over surface of batter and mix until combined — and then, for extra security that the ingredients are well-dispersed, give it 10 extra stirs. Add flour and mix until just combined. Pour into prepared loaf pan and smooth the top. Sprinkle with the raw or turbinado sugar — don’t skimp. Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, until a toothpick or tester inserted into the middle cake but also into the top of the cake, closer to the dome, comes out batter-free. Let cool completely in the pan. Leave in pan, unwrapped, overnight or 24 hours, until removing (carefully, so not to ruin flaky lid) and serving in slices. Zucchini bread keeps for 4 to 5 days at room temperature. I wrap only the cut end of the cake in foil, and return it to the baking pan, leaving the top exposed so that it stays crunchy.","2 cups (13 ounces or 370 grams) grated, packed zucchini, not wrung out, grated on the large holes of a box grater; 2 large eggs; 2/3 cup (160 ml) of a neutral oil (I use safflower), olive oil, or melted unsalted butter; 1/2 cup (95 grams) packed dark brown sugar; 1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract; 1 teaspoon fine sea or table salt; 1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon; 1/8 teaspoon ground or freshly grated nutmeg; 3/4 teaspoon baking soda; 1/2 teaspoon baking powder; 2 cups (260 grams) all-purpose flour; 2 tablespoons (25 grams) raw or turbinado sugar"
26,Bruschetta,"Prep the tomato topping. Stir together the diced tomatoes, basil, red onion, olive oil and a pinch of salt together in a mixing bowl until evenly combined. Cover and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes or up to 24 hours. Make the crostini. Follow recipe instructions. Add garlic. Slice off the ends of the garlic cloves (without removing the papery skins). Then rub the cut end of the garlic evenly over the tops of the bread slices to add as much or as little garlic flavor as you prefer, to taste. Assemble. Taste the tomato topping and season with additional salt (and black pepper, if you’d like) to taste. Add a spoonful of the tomato topping mixture to each slice of bread, then drizzle a hint of olive oil over the tomato topping. Serve. Serve immediately and enjoy!","1 pound ripe tomatoes*, cored and diced; 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil leaves; 1/3 cup finely-diced red onion (optional); 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for brushing/drizzling; fine sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper; 1 batch homemade crostini; 2 large cloves garlic, unpeeled"
27,Easy Frittata,"Preheat the oven to 350ºF. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper. Set the eggs aside. Dice on yellow onion. Heat a 10-inch oven-safe skillet over medium, then add the cooking oil and onion and sauté until the onions are soft and translucent. Meanwhile, roughly chop the spinach and slice the tomatoes in half. Add the spinach and tomatoes to the skillet and stir to combine with the onions. Before the spinach has a chance to cook or wilt, pour in the egg mixture (it's okay if the eggs don't fully cover the vegetables). Top with the crumbled feta. Let the frittata continue to cook over medium just until the eggs are set around the edges (about 3 minutes). Transfer the frittata to the oven and bake for about 15 minutes, or just until the eggs are set in the center (total bake time will vary). Remove the frittata from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.",6 large eggs; 1/4 cup milk; 1/2 tsp salt; 1/4 tsp pepper; 2 Tbsp cooking oil; 1 yellow onion; 2 cups fresh spinach (about 4 oz.); 1 pint grape tomatoes; 1/4 cup crumbled feta
28,New York Crumb Cake,"Heat oven: To 350°F (175°C). Lightly coat an 8-inch square or 9-inch cake pan with butter or nonstick spray. For extra security, line it with parchment paper. Make crumbs: Whisk butter, sugars, cinnamon, and salt together until evenly mixed. Add flour and mix until it disappears. It’s going to be very thick; press it evenly into the bottom of the bowl and set it aside. Make cake: Beat butter with sugar until lightened and fluffy. Add egg, water or milk, sour cream, and vanilla and beat until combined. Sprinkle surface of batter with baking powder and salt, and beat well to combine. Add flour and mix only until it disappears. Assemble: Scrape batter into prepared cake pan and smooth it flat. Use a spoon to loosen the crumbs from the bottom of the bowl where they’ve rested, breaking them up into big and small rubble. Sprinkle evenly over the batter. Bake: Bake for about 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake just below the crumbs comes out batter-free. Check in a few spots, in case it has baked unevenly. Cool to lukewarm, if you can bear it, before dusting it generously with powdered sugar and cutting the cake into squares or wedges. Do ahead: This cake keeps in an airtight container at room temperature for 3 to 4 days, but I like it best in the first two.","Crumbs; 10 tablespoons (140 grams) unsalted butter, melted; 1/2 cup (110 grams) dark brown sugar; 1/4 cup (50 grams) granulated sugar; 1 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon; 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt; 1 2/3 cups (215 grams) all-purpose flour; Cake; 6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter, softened; 1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar; 1 large egg; 1/2 cup (120 grams) sour cream; 2 tablespoons (30ml) water or milk; 1 teaspoon (5ml) vanilla extract; 1 cup (130 grams) all-purpose flour; 1 1/4 teaspoon baking powder; 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt; Cake; Powdered sugar, for dusting"

30,Cherry Lime Smoothie,"First soak your pitted dates in 1 cup of very warm water for at least 5 minutes. This will help them soften up and perfect for blending. While the dates are soaking you can get all your other ingredients out, measured and ready. Add all ingredients to a high powered blender: frozen cherries, lime zest, lime juice, pitted dates, greek yogurt, vanilla, milk, and ice.

31,"Damn Good Peanut Butter Banana Cake (gluten free, grain free)","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line the bottom of three 6-inch round cake pans or two 8-inch round cake pans with parchment paper rounds. Spray parchment paper and sides of pan with nonstick cooking spray. YOU SHOULD USE PARCHMENT PAPER or the cake is likely to stick. Please do not forget. In a large bowl, whisk together mashed bananas, eggs, pure maple syrup, peanut butter and vanilla extract until smooth. In a large bowl, whisk the almond flour, coconut flour, baking soda and salt together. Set aside. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon until well combined. Fold in mini chocolate chips. Divide batter evenly between pans and spread out with a spatula to smooth the tops. Bake for 20-30 minutes if using two 8-inch pans and 25-35 minutes for three 6-inch pans. Cakes are done when a tester comes out clean or with just a few crumbs attached. Allow cake to cool completely before frosting or removing from the pans. The cake should be room temperature or cold when you frost it. This is very important. Cakes can be made a day ahead and stored in the fridge if you’d like. Make your frosting: In the bowl of an electric mixer, add the softened butter and peanut butter and whip on high until light and fluffy. Add powdered sugar, vanilla and 2 tablespoons almond milk. Beat slow at first, then increase speed to high and beat for approximately two minutes. Frosting should be nice and creamy, if you want it extra creamy, add another tablespoon of almond milk and beat again. Now it’s time to frost the cake: place about 1-2 tablespoons down onto the cake stand and spread out. Invert 1 cake onto the cake stand, add about ½ heaping cup frosting between each layer, repeat with each cake, then frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting. If you’d like, you can do a crumb coat for the frosting first (to avoid crumbs in the frosting) by doing the following: Frost the layers as you normally would and then coat the outside of the cake with a very thin layer of frosting and place in fridge for 10-15 minutes before you finish frosting. This is so that the crumbs stick to this layer of frosting and not your main layer. Cake will stay good for 5-7 days in the fridge, and should be covered to ensure freshness. Serves 16.","Wet ingredients; 3 very overripe medium bananas, mashed (1 ¼ cup mashed overripe banana); 4 large eggs, at room temperature; ¾ cup (234g) pure maple syrup; ¾ cup (192g) natural creamy peanut butter (only peanuts & salt as ingredients); 2 teaspoons vanilla extract; Dry ingredients; 2 cups (224g) packed super fine blanched almond flour (I use Bob's Red Mill); ½ cup (56g) coconut flour (do not pack); 1 teaspoon baking soda; ½ teaspoon salt; 1 cup (180g) mini chocolate chips, dairy free if desired; For the frosting:; ½ cup (113g) butter, at room temperature (or sub vegan butter); ½ cup (128g) natural creamy peanut butter (just peanuts + salt); 2 cups (226g) powdered sugar; 1 teaspoon vanilla; 2-3 tablespoons unsweetened almond milk (or milk of choice), to make the frosting creamy; To garnish the cake:; Mini chocolate chips around the edges of the cake"
32,Summer Pea Salad with Unexpected Dressing,"Make the dressing: Chop the raisins into rough bits and place in a bowl with shallots. Pour vinegar over and stir to combine. Let sit, cool, and infuse while you prepare the remaining parts of the salad. [Note: It is completely up to you whether you wish to cook sugar snaps and/or snow peas; both are delicious raw. For this salad, I cook the sugar snaps for 30 seconds to 1 minute but leave the snow peas raw.] Cook your peas: Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Prepare a large bowl of ice water. If using favas or shelling peas, remove them from and discard their pods. Cook favas in the water for 3 minutes; shelling peas for 1 minute, and sugar snaps and/or snow peas for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Scoop each out immediately with a slotted spoon and drop in the ice bath. If you choose to not cook your sugar snaps or snow peas, skip the pot and put them directly in ice water for 10 minutes for the best juicy crunch. One peas are fully cold, drain and pat dry on a large towel. If you’ve used favas, they have one final step of preparation: You’ll need to make a small slit with a sharp paring knife in the outer light green pod so that the inner dark green enjoyable part of the fava can slip out. Finish the dressing: Add dijon, if using, 3 tablespoons olive oil, salt (about 1/2 teaspoon Diamond kosher), freshly ground black pepper, and red pepper flakes to dressing and whisk to combine, tasting for seasoning and adjusting as needed. If you’d like it less kicky, add remaining tablespoon olive oil. Assemble and finish: Transfer peas to a bowl and toss with dressing to taste; you may not need it all. Add more seasoning, if needed. Add almonds, cheese, and mint and toss once again. Eat right away. Do ahead: Vegetables and dressing can be prepared and kept cool, separately, up to a day in advance. Mix only before serving.","1/4 cup golden raisins; 1/4 cup white wine vinegar, warmed; 2 tablespoons minced shallot; 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds fresh summer peas, such as sugar snaps, snow peas, shelling peas, and/or favas; Kosher salt; 1/2 teaspoon smooth dijon mustard (optional); 3 to 4 tablespoons olive oil; Red pepper flakes and freshly ground black pepper, to taste; 1/2 cup toasted almonds (I’m using marcona), roughly chopped; 2 to 3 ounces sliced or crumbled ricotta salata cheese; 1/4 cup chopped fresh mint"

42,Incredible naan breads,"Combine the yeast, honey and 125ml of lukewarm water in a bowl, then set aside for 5 minutes, or until starting to bubble. Melt the ghee in a small pan over a low heat. Meanwhile, combine the flour and ½ tablespoon of sea salt in a large bowl and make a well in the middle. Pour 1 tablespoon of the melted ghee into the well, followed by the yoghurt and yeast mixture, then beat the wet ingredients together with a fork. Gradually start incorporating the flour from the sides until it starts to form a rough dough, then bring it together with your hands – it should be soft and sticky, so add a splash more water, if you think it needs it. Knead the dough on a flour-dusted surface for around 5 minutes, or until smooth, then place into a lightly floured bowl. Cover with a clean tea towel and leave in a warm place for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until doubled in size. Once risen, knock back the dough with your fist, then divide into 6 balls. Roll each portion into an oval shape, roughly 1½cm thick. Heat a large non-stick frying pan over a high heat, add a naan bread and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, or until cooked through, turning halfway.

43,The Best Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies,"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds to just barely melt it. It shouldn’t be hot – but it should be almost entirely in liquid form. Using a stand mixer or electric beaters, beat the butter with the sugars until creamy. Add the vanilla and the egg; beat on low speed until just incorporated – 10-15 seconds or so (if you beat the egg for too long, the cookies will be stiff). Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until crumbles form. Use your hands to press the crumbles together into a dough. It should form one large ball that is easy to handle (right at the stage between “wet” dough and “dry” dough). Add the chocolate chips and incorporate with your hands. Roll the dough into 12 large balls (or 9 for HUGELY awesome cookies) and place on a cookie sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes until the cookies look puffy and dry and just barely golden. Warning, friends: DO NOT OVERBAKE. This advice is probably written on every cookie recipe everywhere, but this is essential for keeping the cookies soft. Take them out even if they look like they’re not done yet (see picture in the post). They’ll be pale and puffy. Let them cool on the pan for a good 30 minutes or so (I mean, okay, eat four or five but then let the rest of them cool). They will sink down and turn into these dense, buttery, soft cookies that are the best in all the land. These should stay soft for many days if kept in an airtight container. I also like to freeze them.",8 tablespoons of salted butter; 1/2 cup white sugar (I like to use raw cane sugar with a coarser texture); 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar; 1 teaspoon vanilla; 1 egg; 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour (6.75 ounces); 1/2 teaspoon baking soda; 1/4 teaspoon salt (but I always add a little extra); 3/4 cup chocolate chips (I use a combination of chocolate chips and chocolate chunks)

45,Honey Salmon with Ginger Scallion Sauce,"Prep the oven and baking sheet. Heat oven to 425°F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Prep the salmon. Place the salmon filets skin-side-down at the end of the prepared baking sheet. Whisk together the soy sauce and honey in a small bowl until combined, then brush it evenly on top of the salmon. Prep the green beans. Lay the green beans in a tight pile on the other end of the baking sheet and drizzle with the olive oil. Toss until evenly coated, then arrange the green beans in an even layer covering the rest of the baking sheet. Season the green beans and the salmon generously with salt and pepper. Roast. Bake for 10 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked to your liking. (I prefer to remove my salmon when the internal temperature measures 135°F, as it will continue to cook slightly more as it rests. Please note that cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of your salmon filets.) Transfer the pan to a wire cooling rack and drizzle the salmon and green beans with the juice of 1 lime. Make the ginger scallion sauce. Heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until tiny bubbles begin to form around the sides of the pan. (If you drop a scallion in the oil, it should sizzle vigorously.) While the oil is heating, combine the white parts of the scallions, ginger and garlic in a small heat-proof* (see note below) bowl or measuring cup. Once the oil is hot, very carefully pour it on top of the scallion mixture (it will sizzle and sputter!) and gently stir to combine. Add the soy sauce and the green parts of the scallions stir to combine. Taste and season with extra salt and pepper as needed. Serve.

To give a creamy texture, blend approximately half of the soup (BE CAREFUL WHILE DOING THIS!) then return to the pot. Stir to incorporate and then taste and adjust seasonings -- adding in more salt and pepper if necessary. You can blend more if you like a creamier soup, but I love a little texture. Finally stir in the chicken, black beans and lime juice. To serve, garnish with shredded cheese, scallions, cilantro, avocado and a swirl of greek yogurt or sour cream (if not vegan).

Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, then decrease the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook, uncovered, until the quinoa has absorbed all of the water, about 15 minutes, reducing heat as time goes on to maintain a gentle simmer.

Alternatively you can arrange the salad on a platter if you are entertaining. Next make the dilly tahini dressing by mixing together the ingredients for the dressing in a bowl: tahini, lemon juice, maple syrup, water, dill, garlic powder, salt and pepper.

59,Grilled Feta with Asparagus Chimichurri,"Make the chimichurri: Place garlic, oregano, and red chili in a food processor or high speed blender and blend until chopped. Strip the leaves from the parsley and add them to the blender, pulsing the machine until the parsley is well-chopped. Add olive oil, kosher salt, and black pepper and blend until the parsley is finely chopped. Transfer to a bowl and stir in vinegar. If you’ve got time before using it, chimichurri tastes great after resting at room temperature for 30 minutes to 2 hours before using. No blender? Finely chop all the ingredients by hand, stirring in the oil and vinegar. Grill everything else: Heat your grill to a high temperature; I like a quick char on everything here. Arrange baguette slices, onion, and asparagus on a large tray (but keeping items separate) and drizzle everything with olive oil and season it with salt and pepper. Pat feta block dry and place in a small cast-iron skillet or a piece of foil folded a few times so it’s a little sturdier. Drizzle feta with olive oil, too, and head outside. My grill is tiny, so I have to grill items one at a time. Start with the baguette slices, arranging them in one layer and flipping them with tongs as soon as they get licks of color underneath. Transfer bread back to the tray and grill the onion slices, until they have brown marks all over. As soon as they come off the grill, place them in a medium-large bowl with a big spoonful of the chimichurri, so they mellow and sweeten further. Next grill the asparagus, rolling it over as soon as it gets some char underneath, and repeating on the remaining parts. Transfer the asparagus back to the tray, and grill the feta last. Place the pan or foil holding the feta directly on the grill and let it heat for 5 to 10 minutes. If you can multitask, use the feta grilling time to cut the asparagus into 1/2-inch segments on an angle and transfer it to the bowl with the onions and pour in all but the the last 2 tablespoons chimichurri, stirring to combine. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Assemble and serve: When the feta is very hot throughout and maybe even browned a little at the edges, use a spatula to carefully transfer it from the grill to a serving plate. Arrange the baguette slices around one half of it, and spoon the asparagus chimichurri around the other half. Spoon some extra chimichurri over the feta. Eat right away, smooshing the feta on the toasts and spooning the asparagus on top. The feta is the creamiest when it’s still piping hot, but it will still be delicious even after it has cooled. No grill? You can make each element in the oven — the broiler works great here, just keep an eye on the bread and feta, as they’ll brown much faster.","Chimichurri; 3 large or 4 regular cloves garlic; 3/4 teaspoon dried oregano or 1 1/2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves; 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh red chili pepper or 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes; 4 ounce bundle flat-leaf parsley [or 1/2 cup finely-chopped leaves]; 1/2 cup olive oil; 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt; Freshly ground black pepper, to taste; 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar; Assembly; 1 baguette, sliced 1/2-inch-thick on an angle; 1 large red onion, cut into thin wedges; 1 pound asparagus spears, trimmed; Salt and freshly ground black pepper; Olive oil; 8-ounce block feta; "

Replace the lid and allow the skillet to continue to cook over low for an additional 5 minutes.  Remove the skillet from the heat and allow it to rest, lid in place, for an additional five minutes. After resting, lift the lid. The shrimp should be opaque and pink.  Use a fork to carefully fluff the rice and partially stir the cooked shrimp into the rice.

63,Favorite Veggie Burgers,"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for easy clean-up. Roast the sweet potatoes: Slice the sweet potatoes down the center lengthwise. Place the sweet potatoes, cut side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Roast until they yield to a gentle squeeze, 30 to 40 minutes or longer. Set aside for now. (If you’ll be baking the burgers, reserve the parchment-lined pan and leave the oven on.) Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the quinoa and water. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Simmer, uncovered, until all of the water is absorbed, 11 to 14 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, cover, and let the quinoa steam for 10 minutes. Once the sweet potatoes are cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin (it should pull off easily) and roughly chop the insides. In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of your electric mixer, combine the cooled sweet potatoes and quinoa, black beans, onion, cilantro, garlic, adobo sauce, cumin, chili powder, and salt. Use a potato masher, pastry cutter, large spoon or the paddle attachment of your mixer to mix really well. It’s ok if the black beans get smashed in the process. Sprinkle the oats over the mixture and mix well with a large spoon until the mixture holds together when you shape a portion into a patty. If you won’t be making the burgers immediately, cover the mixture and refrigerate for later. When you’re ready to cook, shape the burgers: Use a measuring cup to measure out ½ cup of the mixture. Gently shape it into a patty about 3 ½ to 4 inches in diameter. Use your hands to gently flatten the burgers and smooth out any jagged edges. Repeat the process for each patty; you should end up with 8. If you’re baking the burgers (see recipe notes for alternate options), brush both sids of each patty generously with olive oil and place them on the lined baking sheet, leaving a few inches of space around each one. Bake at 400 degrees Fahrenheit until the patties are deeply golden on the outside, about 35 minutes, flipping halfway. Serve burgers as desired. Leftover burgers keep well, refrigerated, for 4 days.

65,Easy peasy ginger beer,"Ginger beer is one of my favourite things in the world, especially blooming good in the summer when it's getting hot. I can't think of anything more sexy than having a big jug of iced ginger beer on the table with a barbecue on a hot day. The classic real ginger beers use a starter, and these are fantastic but slow, so here's my shortcut for getting amazing results taking hardly any time. First of all you need to grate your ginger on a coarse cheese grater – you can leave the skin on if you like. Put the ginger with its pulpy juice into a bowl and sprinkle in your muscovado sugar. Remove the rind from 2 of your lemons with a vegetable peeler, add to the bowl, and slightly bash and squash with something heavy like a pestle or a rolling-pin. Just do this for 10 seconds, to mix up all the flavours. Squeeze the juice from all 3 lemons and add most of it to the bowl. Pour in your fizzy water or soda water. Allow to sit for 10 minutes and then taste. You may feel that the lemons are slightly too sour, therefore add a little more sugar; if it's slightly too sweet, add a little more lemon juice. To be honest, these amounts are always a little variable so just follow your own taste. Pass the ginger beer through a coarse sieve into a large jug and add lots of ice and some sprigs of mint.",140 g fresh ginger; 4 tablespoons muscovado sugar; 2-3 lemons; 1 litre soda water or sparkling mineral water; a few sprigs of fresh mint
66,Blueberry Crumb Cake,"Heat oven to 375°F. Butter a 9-inch round baking pan (with at least 2″ sides) and dust it lightly with flour; line it with a round of parchment paper. Prepare the topping by mixing the flour, sugar, cinnamon and salt, then cutting the butter in with a pastry blender, fork or your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, and salt until combined. In a large bowl, beat butter, sugar and zest together until light and fluffy. Add egg and vanilla and beat until combined. Beat in 1/3 of the dry ingredient mixture until just combined, followed by 1/2 the milk; repeat with remaining dry ingredients and milk, finishing with the dry mixture. The batter will be very stiff, but don’t fret. Fold blueberries into cake batter until evenly distributed. Scoop cake batter into prepared pan and smooth so that it is flat. If using walnuts, scatter them on top. Sprinkle with prepared streusel. Bake in heated oven for 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake comes out batter-free. You can let the cake cool complete in the pan on a rack, or just cool it in the pan for 20 minutes before flipping it out onto a cooling rack, removing the parchment paper lining, and flipping it back onto a plate. Dust with confectioners’ sugar, if using. Do ahead: Cake keeps covered with plastic or foil at room temperature for three days. If longer, it might be best to keep it in the fridge. It gets more moist each day.","Topping:; 5 tablespoons (40 grams) all-purpose flour; 1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar; 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon; 4 tablespoons (1/4 cup, 2 ounces or 55 grams) unsalted butter, cold is fine; Pinch of salt; Cake:; 2 cups minus 1 tablespoon (i.e. 1 3/4 cups + 3 tablespoons or 240 grams) all-purpose flour; 2 teaspoons baking powder; 1/2 teaspoon table salt; 4 tablespoons (1/4 cup, 2 ounces or 55 grams) unsalted butter, softened; 3/4 cup (150 grams) granulated sugar; Zest of 1 lemon; 1 large egg; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract; 1 pint (2 to 2 2/3 cups, 12 to 16 ounces, or 340 to 455 grams; see Note) fresh blueberries, clean and dry; 1/2 cup milk, whole is ideal, any kind should work; 1/2 cup (55 grams) walnuts, chopped medium fine (optional); Confectioners’ sugar, for dusting (optional)"

69,Amazing Green Rice,"Rice Prep: Thoroughly rinse the rise in a mesh colander. Shake it a few times to remove excess water, or blot it dry with paper towels. (This prevents it from splattering in the oil when you add it to the pan in Step 3.) Make Green Herb Mixture: Pulse the cilantro, spinach, shallot, serrano, and garlic in a food processor until very finely chopped. Saute the Rice: Add olive oil to a skillet over medium high heat. Add rice and sauté for 3-5 minutes until lightly toasted.

Roast at 425 / 20 minutes in the air fryer, or 425 / 30 minutes in the oven until nice and roasty and golden. Make the mint sauce: Blitz everything up until it’s nice and smooth. I like to really blend this one so it’s less chunky and more of a smooth green sauce. Butter sauce time: Add butter sauce and chickpeas to a large skillet. Smash the chickpeas lightly with a potato masher to give a more interesting texture if you want (I do want). Add cauliflower back in.  Serve: Serve the butter cauliflower on rice and top with the mint sauce. Add pickled onions if you want.

74,Wine-braised chicken,"Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5. Joint the chicken into 8 pieces. Heat a lug of oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Season the chicken, add it to the pan in batches, and fry until golden all over. Set aside on a plate. Peel and cut the onions into wedges, chop the carrots, then peel and finely chop the garlic. Add the veg to the pan and gently sauté for about 15 minutes over a medium-low heat, or until soft and sticky but not coloured. Return the chicken to the pan.

75,Zuppa Toscana,"Add the sausage to a large soup pot and sauté over medium heat, breaking it up into small pieces as it cooks. The sausage should contain enough fat to keep it from sticking, if not add a touch of olive oil. It’s okay if a small amount browns on the bottom of the pot. While the sausage is cooking, dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the onion and garlic to the pot and sauté until the onions are softened. The moisture from the onions should help dissolve any browned bits of sausage off the bottom of the pot. Drain and rinse the can of beans. Add the beans, smoked paprika, chicken broth, one cup water, and half and half to the pot. Place a lid on the pot and let it come up to a simmer over medium heat. While the pot is heating, cut each potato into quarters lengthwise, then slice across into thin, 1/8-inch thick slices. Add the potatoes to the pot along with the pre-chopped kale. The kale will fill the pot when it’s first added, but the heat from the liquid will wilt it within a few minutes. Stir it occasionally to help the wilting process. Let the pot simmer over medium heat for about 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. Season with red pepper flakes and freshly cracked black pepper if desired.","1/2 lb.

77,Bolognese ravioli,"Put all the minced meat into your largest pan on a high heat with a good lug of oil and a pinch of sea salt and pepper. Cook for 20 minutes, or until golden, stirring regularly. Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the garlic, onions, carrots and celery. When the mince has got a good colour, add all the chopped veg and cook for a further 10 minutes, then add the Chianti and cook it away. Pour in the tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon, and add half a tin’s worth of water. Bring to the boil, then simmer gently for 1 hour, or until the meat is tender and the sauce is super-thick. Remove from the heat to cool, then finely grate and stir in the Parmesan. Now it’s time to assemble your pasta. Following the instructions for making the pasta dough, roll out your dough to 1mm thick, then make your ravioli about 7cm square. I work with a quarter of the pasta at a time to give more control. Use a heaped teaspoon of filling in the centre of each one, sealing the edges with a light brushing of water and pushing out the air – you should get about 50 to 60 ravioli from this amount of pasta. Place them on a semolina-dusted tray as you go. Freeze the remaining Bolognese (you’ll have roughly half left) for a rainy day, or make a double batch of pasta and freeze as ravioli – you can cook them from frozen in the sauce. Put a pan of salted water on to boil for the pasta. For the sauce, peel and roughly chop the garlic and deseed and finely chop the chillies. Place a pan on a medium heat, add a lug of oil and the garlic and chilli, and fry for a few minutes, or until very lightly golden. Add the tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes, or until thickened and reduced, then remove from the heat and blitz until smooth with a stick blender. Taste and season to perfection, then place back on a very low heat. Cook the ravioli in the boiling salted water for 3 minutes, or until tender, then use a slotted spoon to transfer them to the sauce. Gently toss together and simmer for another couple of minutes, then divide between warm bowls, scatter with baby basil leaves and serve with a few extra gratings of Parmesan, if you like.","FILLING; 400 g higher-welfare minced pork; 400 g higher-welfare minced veal , or beef; olive oil; 2 cloves of garlic; 2 onions; 2 carrots; 2 sticks of celery; 200 ml Chianti Classico; 2 x 400 g tins of quality plum tomatoes; 100 g Parmesan cheese , plus extra to serve; PASTA; 1 x Royal pasta dough; fine semolina; SAUCE; 4 cloves of garlic; 1-2 fresh red chillies; 3 x 400 g tins of quality plum tomatoes; a few sprigs of fresh basil"

90,Hunter's chicken stew (Pollo alla cacciatora),"Chicken cacciatora seems to be reasonably well known in Britain because it’s the classic pre-packed dish you find in Italian food ranges in supermarkets (which, to be honest, never taste of much). When you get the real deal cooked at home with love and passion it’s a totally different experience. It’s a simple combination of flavours that just works really well. Cacciatore means ‘hunter’, so this is obviously the type of food that a hunter’s wife cooks for her fella when he gets home from a hard morning spent in the countryside. This is also a great dish for big parties, as it looks after itself in the oven. In the picture I’ve made it for about 12 people. Season the chicken pieces with salt and freshly ground black pepper and put them into a bowl. Add the bay leaves and rosemary sprigs and the crushed clove of garlic and cover with the wine. Leave to marinate for at least an hour, but preferably overnight in the fridge. Preheat your oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Drain the chicken, reserving the marinade, and pat dry with kitchen paper. Dust the chicken pieces with flour and shake off any excess. Heat an ovenproof pan, add a splash of olive oil, fry the chicken pieces until browned lightly all over and put to one side. Place the pan back on the heat and add the sliced garlic. Fry gently until golden brown, then add the anchovies, olives, tomatoes (broken up with a wooden spoon) and the chicken pieces with their reserved marinade. Bring to the boil, cover with a lid or a double thickness layer of foil and bake in the preheated oven for 1½ hours. Skim off any oil that’s collected on top of the sauce, then stir, taste and add a little salt and pepper if necessary. Remove the bay leaves and rosemary sprigs, and serve with a salad, or some cannellini beans, and plenty of Chianti.","2 kg higher-welfare chicken, jointed , or use the equivalent amount of chicken pieces; sea salt; freshly ground black pepper; 8 bay leaves; 2 sprigs fresh rosemary; 3 cloves garlic , peeled (1 crushed, 2 sliced); ½ bottle Chianti; flour , for dusting; extra virgin olive oil; 6 anchovy fillets; 1 handful green or black olives , stoned; 2 x 400 g good-quality tinned plum tomatoes"

Finely chop all the ingredients by hand, stirring in the oil and vinegar. Grill everything else: Heat your grill to a high temperature; I like a quick char on everything here. Arrange baguette slices, onion, and asparagus on a large tray (but keeping items separate) and drizzle everything with olive oil and season it with salt and pepper. Pat feta block dry and place in a small cast-iron skillet or a piece of foil folded a few times so it’s a little sturdier. Drizzle feta with olive oil, too, and head outside. My grill is tiny, so I have to grill items one at a time. Start with the baguette slices, arranging them in one layer and flipping them with tongs as soon as they get licks of color underneath. Transfer bread back to the tray and grill the onion slices, until they have brown marks all over. As soon as they come off the grill, place them in a medium-large bowl with a big spoonful of the chimichurri, so they mellow and sweeten further. Next grill the asparagus, rolling it over as soon as it gets some char underneath, and repeating on the remaining parts. Transfer the asparagus back to the tray, and grill the feta last. Place the pan or foil holding the feta directly on the grill and let it heat for 5 to 10 minutes. If you can multitask, use the feta grilling time to cut the asparagus into 1/2-inch segments on an angle and transfer it to the bowl with the onions and pour in all but the the last 2 tablespoons chimichurri, stirring to combine. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Assemble and serve: When the feta is very hot throughout and maybe even browned a little at the edges, use a spatula to carefully transfer it from the grill to a serving plate. Arrange the baguette slices around one half of it, and spoon the asparagus chimichurri around the other half. Spoon some extra chimichurri over the feta. Eat right away, smooshing the feta on the toasts and spooning the asparagus on top. The feta is the creamiest when it’s still piping hot, but it will still be delicious even after it has cooled. No grill? You can make each element in the oven — the broiler works great here, just keep an eye on the bread and feta, as they’ll brown much faster.","Chimichurri; 3 large or 4 regular cloves garlic; 3/4 teaspoon dried oregano or 1 1/2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves; 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh red chili pepper or 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes; 4 ounce bundle flat-leaf parsley [or 1/2 cup finely-chopped leaves]; 1/2 cup olive oil; 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt; Freshly ground black pepper, to taste; 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar; Assembly; 1 baguette, sliced 1/2-inch-thick on an angle; 1 large red onion, cut into thin wedges; 1 pound asparagus spears, trimmed; Salt and freshly ground black pepper; Olive oil; 8-ounce block feta; "
116,Pasta with 5 Ingredient Butter Tomato Sauce,"To make the toasted bread crumbs, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the bread crumbs, salt, oregano, and some freshly cracked pepper. Cook and stir the bread crumbs continuously until they achieve a deep golden color. Remove them from the skillet and let cool until ready to use. To make the sauce, mince the garlic and add it to a large deep skillet with the butter. Sauté the garlic in the butter over medium heat for about a minute, or just until it becomes fragrant. Add the can of tomatoes, along with all the juices, and some freshly cracked pepper. Break the tomatoes up into a few chunks with your spoon (they should be soft and easily crushed). Stir the ingredients in the skillet, then let it come up to a simmer. Once it reaches a simmer, reduce the heat to medium-low and let it continue to simmer, without a lid, for about 30 minutes. Stir the sauce occasionally as it simmers, breaking the tomatoes into smaller pieces as you stir. While the sauce simmers, cook the pasta according to the package directions. Save about 1/2 cup of the starchy cooking water before draining the pasta in a colander. After simmering for 30 minutes, the sauce should have thickened and become slightly less acidic and slightly more sweet. Season the sauce with a final 1/2 tsp of salt (or to your liking). Add the cooked and drained pasta to the sauce and toss to coat. Use some of the reserved starchy cooking water to loosen the pasta if it becomes too dry. Top the pasta and sauce with a generous sprinkle of toasted bread crumbs, then serve.",2 Tbsp olive oil; 1/2 cup breadcrumbs; 1/4 tsp salt; 1/2 tsp dried oregano; Freshly cracked Pepper; 8 oz. pasta; 4 Tbsp salted butter; 3 cloves garlic; 28 oz. can whole peeled tomatoes*; 1/2 tsp salt (or to taste); Freshly cracked pepper

Using a sharp paring knife carefully cut and remove the stem from the top half of each bell pepper (see picture below). It's okay if there is a small hole left where the stem was removed. Place each bell pepper half in a 9×13-inch casserole dish. Brush the bell peppers with 1 Tbsp oil and season with ¼ tsp of salt and ¼ tsp cracked black pepper. Bake the bell peppers in a preheated oven for 20 minutes to soften. After 20 minutes remove the bell peppers from the oven and set aside. While the bell peppers are baking, make the filling.

129,Herby Chicken Meatball Pitas with Jalapeño Tzatziki,"Make jalapeno tzatziki sauce: While the meatballs cook, make your jalapeno tzatziki sauce by combining all ingredients for tzatziki sauce and diced jalapeno in a medium bowl. Set aside or cover and place in the fridge until ready to serve. This can also be made 1 to 2 days ahead of time. Prepare the meatballs: Fill a small bowl with water and place it on the counter. In a large bowl, add the ground chicken, egg, panko, red onion, garlic, jalapeno, parsley, mint, dill, oregano, lemon zest, salt and black pepper. Use clean hands to mix until well combined; avoid overmixing otherwise the meatballs will become tough. Form into 16 golf ball sized meatballs, dipping your hands in water between each meatball to prevent sticking. To pan-fry the meatball (my preference for more flavor!): In a large, deep nonstick skillet, warm 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the meatballs, leaving about ½ inch between each (you may need to do this in batches, depending on how many meatballs you can fit in your skillet without overcrowding them), and brown on all sides until cooked through (a meat thermometer should register 165°F degrees), 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer the meatballs to a plate and repeat with the remaining meatballs, adding more oil, if necessary. To bake the meatballs: Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the meatballs at least an 1 inch apart on the parchment paper. Bake until a meat thermometer inserted into the meatball reads 165°F, 17 to 22 minutes.

130,BA's Best Eggplant Parmesan,"Preheat oven to 350°. Place a Dutch oven or other large heavy ovenproof pot over medium heat. Add ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil and 1 head of garlic, cloves crushed, and cook, stirring often, until garlic is golden, about 4 minutes. Add 1 large red onion, chopped, 3 oil-packed anchovy fillets (if using), and ½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes and cook, stirring often, until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1 Tbsp. tomato paste and cook, stirring often, until slightly darkened, about 2 minutes. Add ¼ cup dry white wine, bring to a boil, and cook until almost completely evaporated, about 1 minute. Add two 28-oz. cans whole peeled tomatoes, breaking up with your hands, and their juices; add ¼ cup torn basil leaves and ½ tsp. dried oregano and stir to combine. Swirl 1½ cups water into one tomato can, then the other, to rinse, and add to pot; season with kosher salt. Transfer pot to oven; roast sauce, stirring halfway through, until thick and tomatoes are browned on top and around edges of pot, 2–2½ hours. Let sauce cool slightly. Pass through the large holes of a food mill or process in a food processor until mostly smooth. Taste and season with salt. Do Ahead: Sauce can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill. Lightly season 4 lb. Italian eggplants (about 4 medium eggplants), peeled, sliced lengthwise ½""–¾"" thick, all over with kosher salt; place in a single layer on several layers of paper towels inside a rimmed baking sheet. Top with another layer of paper towels and more slices; repeat as needed. Top with a final layer of paper towels, then another rimmed baking sheet; weigh down with a heavy pot. Let sliced eggplant sit until it has released excess liquid, 45–60 minutes. This step gives the eggplant a creamy texture when baked. Meanwhile, pulse 3 cups panko breadcrumbs, 1½ tsp. dried oregano, 1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper, and ¾ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese in a food processor until very finely ground. Transfer to a shallow bowl. Preheat oven to 350°. Place 1½ cups (187.5 g) all-purpose flour in another shallow bowl and 5 large eggs, beaten to blend, in a third shallow bowl. Working one at a time, dredge eggplant slices in flour, then dip in egg, allowing excess to drip off. Coat in breadcrumb mixture, packing all around, then shaking off excess. Place on wire racks. Heat ⅔ cup extra-virgin olive oil in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Cook as many eggplant slices as will comfortably fit in pan, turning once, until deep golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels and immediately press with more paper towel to absorb oil. Working in batches, repeat with remaining eggplant, adding remaining ⅔ cup extra-virgin olive oil and wiping out skillet as needed. Let cool. Taste and season with more salt if needed. Toss ½ cup finely chopped basil and parsley, 6 oz. low-moisture mozzarella cheese, grated (about 1⅓ cups), and remaining ¾ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese in a medium bowl. Spread 1 cup sauce over the bottom of a 13x9"" baking pan or casserole dish; top with a layer of roasted eggplant slices (trim as needed). Drizzle 1 cup sauce over and sprinkle with one third of cheese mixture. Add another layer of eggplant, followed by 1 cup sauce and half of remaining cheese mixture. Repeat layers with remaining slices, sauce, and cheese mixture. Cover with foil and bake on a rimmed baking sheet until eggplant is custardy, 45–60 minutes. Remove from oven and arrange 8 oz. fresh mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced, over eggplant. Increase oven temperature to 425° and bake, uncovered, until cheese is bubbling and browned in spots, 15–20 minutes longer. Let rest 30 minutes. Top with basil leaves just before slicing. Do Ahead: Eggplant Parmesan can be baked 2 days ahead. Let cool; cover with foil and chill. Reheat in a 350° oven, uncovering halfway through, until bubbling gently at edges.

131,Grilled Cabbage,"Peel away the outermost layers of cabbage and discard them. Cut your cabbage into 2 inch wedges and shave off the very bottom of the stem so it’s nice and clean. I like to cut the cabbage in half first, so I have a steadier base to cut from. You will want to leave the stem intact when you cut your cabbage into wedges so it stays in one piece on the grill. Whisk together the olive oil, minced garlic, sea salt, freshly cracked black pepper, chili flakes, and grated Parmesan in a small bowl. Brush the Parmesan cheese mixture over all sides of each cabbage wedge. Grill the cabbage on each side for 5-6 minutes each on a 400 degree grill. Once you put the cabbage on the grill, resist the urge to move it around. Let it sear in one spot until it’s time to flip. In my opinion, the more char, the better! Dress each grilled cabbage wedge with a drizzle of our balsamic glaze and any additional Parmesan cheese you may have, and sprinkle 1 Tbsp freshly minced parsley on top (all optional). Serve and enjoy!","1 head cabbage (any kind!) cut into 6 wedges*; 1 garlic clove, minced; 3 Tbsp olive oil; 1 tsp sea salt; 1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper; 1 tsp chili flakes; 2 Tbsp grated Parmesan"
132,Braised Chickpeas with Zucchini and Pesto,"Place chickpeas and 1 1/2 cups broth in a large braiser or saucepan. Scatter garlic, onion, pepper flakes, salt, and zucchini on top and drizzle olive oil over. No need to stir.  Bring the ingredients to a simmer and cover with a lid to cook for 45 minutes total. However, at the 15-minute mark, remove the lid (but still, no need to stir yet). At the 30-minute mark, stir ingredients to evenly combine. If all of the liquid is gone from the pan or the chickpeas are sticking to the bottom, add remaining 1/2 cup broth.  Remove pan from heat and stir in pesto in dollops. Make divots for the burrata, using your fingers to tear it into chunks before nudging them into the pan. Finish with some parmesan and extra pepper flakes. Ladle into low bowls and serve with grilled bread. Do ahead: Leftovers keep for 4-5 days in the fridge. If you’re planning ahead, I’d wait to add the finishes (burrata and parmesan) until the chickpeas have reheated. Notes: To keep this gluten-free, you’ll need to use a gluten-free bread for serving.  If the layering of onion, garlic, and vegetables sounds a bit like my One-Pan Farro with Tomatoes, it is not accidental. This dish started as a zucchini riff on it, which came out absolutely deliciously but didn’t feel “new” enough to warrant a new recipe on the site. Plus, we loved the chickpea version even more. If you’d like to make it at home, however, simply add the zucchini here instead of the tomatoes in the original recipe and finish it with the pesto, burrata, and parmesan as written here.","2 15-ounce cans of chickpeas, drained and rinsed; 1 1/2 to 2 cups vegetable broth; 4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced; 1 large yellow onion, halved and thinly sliced; 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes; 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt; 1 pound summer squash or zucchini, quartered lengthwise, thinly sliced; 1/4 cup olive oil; 1/4 cup prepared or storebought basil pesto; 8 ounces of burrata or 1 cup fresh ricotta; Grated parmesan cheese, to finish; Sliced sourdough or country bread, grilled or toasted"
133,Steamed Artichokes,"Trim artichokes: Cut the bottom inch of thorny leaves off each artichoke. Remove any small, discolored leaves around the sides and closer to the stem; they’re not going to taste good. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the outer layer of the stem. Cut each artichoke in half through the stem, heart, and leaves. If you’d like, you can rub the cut parts of each artichoke with one lemon half to limit browning. Steam artichokes: Bring a couple inches of water to boil in a large pot with a lid and place a steamer basket [mine looks like this] in the bottom. Add artichokes — don’t worry about whether they’re standing or flopped over. Squeeze the juice of half a lemon over and nestle the empty lemon half in the middle, just for flavor. Cover with a lid and steam artichokes over moderate heat for 25 to 30 minutes, until the tip of a knife inserts easily into the thickest part where the leaves meet the stem. Use tongs to transfer artichokes to a cutting board, and use a spoon or paring knife to remove and discard the fuzzy choke. Your artichokes are now ready to eat, but if you’d like a fancy finish: For a sizzled finish: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add butter and garlic. Once hot, place cut sides of one artichoke in pan and cook until browned and crisp underneath, then transfer to serving platter. Repeat with remaining artichokes. Pour any butter left in pan and the garlic over your artichokes. Season with salt and pepper. To make my favorite artichoke dip: Place a spoonful of mayo (about 1 to 2 tablespoons, start with less) in a bowl and squeeze the juice of half a lemon over. Stir to combine and season well with freshly ground black pepper and a pinch or two of salt. If it needs more lemon — I like it very lemony — squeeze more in. If you’d prefer it creamier, add more mayo. Leftover artichoke halves keep in the fridge for a few days and can be rewarmed in the microwave or the oven, covered so they don’t dry out.","2 to 3 full-sized fresh artichokes; 1 to 2 lemons, halved; Salt, freshly ground black pepper; A big pat of butter (optional); A few garlic cloves, halved lengthwise (optional); Mayonnaise, for dipping sauce"
134,Endless Summer Tomato Noodle Salad,"Cook 8–9 oz. dried udon noodles or spaghetti in a medium pot of boiling salted water 1 minute longer than package directions.

Meanwhile, slice a thin round off the bottoms of 12 oz. ripe beefsteak or heirloom tomatoes (1–2 large). Starting at cut end, grate tomatoes on the largest holes of a box grater over a large bowl until all that’s left is the flattened tomato skin and stem; discard. Add ⅓ cup creamy peanut butter, ¼ cup apple cider vinegar, ¼ cup chili crisp, 3 Tbsp. soy sauce, and 4 tsp. sugar and whisk vigorously until sauce is smooth and emulsified.

Cover and bake at 350° for 50-60 minutes or until bubbly.","Penne pasta: You’ll need just a standard 1 pound package of penne pasta for this recipe, something you likely have on hand already.; Cooked chicken: The pre-cooked chicken is best if you cook it fresh and cube it yourself, of course, but you can use store-bought cooked chicken that comes in a can or bag.; Italian cheese blend: Don’t skimp on the cheese. It adds flavor and texture and helps bind other ingredients to the pasta noodles.; Fresh baby spinach: The spinach, wilted down into the dish, works in concert with the pesto, helping ground some of the more potent flavors.; Crushed tomatoes: Often, you want to incorporate the liquid in a can of tomatoes into a recipe, but in this case, it’s best to drain most of the fluids.; Alfredo sauce: Thick, creamy, and rich, Alfredo sauce is the anchor of this dish even though it’s pesto that made it into the title.; Milk: 2% milk does well in this recipe and doesn’t need much more creaminess thanks to the Alfredo sauce, but of course, whole milk is most welcome as well.; Pesto: The recipe as written calls for prepared jarred pesto, but if you’ve got quite the home garden bristling with basil, you can go fresh for an even richer taste.; Seasoned bread crumbs: Just a half cup of seasoned bread crumbs brings a lovely texture and a savory touch to this dish.; Parmesan cheese: Our last and tangiest ingredient, save for the oil in which you’ll combine this classic cheese and those bread crumbs, the Parmesan plays a major role here despite each portion of casserole using just a quarter cup.; Olive oil: What’s to be said about olive oil other than it’s as essential to Italian cooking as water is to all of life?; 1 package (16 ounces) penne pasta; 6 cups cubed cooked chicken; 4 cups shredded Italian cheese blend; 3 cups fresh baby spinach; 1 can (15 ounces) crushed tomatoes; 1 jar (15 ounces) Alfredo sauce; 1-1/2 cups 2% milk; 1 jar (8.1 ounces) prepared pesto; 1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs; 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese; 1 tablespoon olive oil"
146,Strawberry ‘Almond Croissant’ Puff Pastry Tarts,"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.

Add the almond flour and almond extract and beat again on high for another 30 seconds until mixture is light and fluffy. Set aside. Lay the sheet of thawed puff pastry on a clean surface lightly dusted with flour and roll out to an approximately 9x13 inch sheet (sometimes they shrink when frozen). Cut the puff pastry into 9 equal rectangles, then lay each piece on the parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving a ½-inch space between each piece. Poke each piece a few times with a fork. Add 1 heaping tablespoon of the almond filling to the middle of each puff pastry and evenly spread towards edges, making a ½-inch border around the edge. Top the filling of each pastry with 3-4 strawberry slices. In a small bowl, whisk the egg with a fork and use a pastry brush to brush on the edges of each puff pastry piece. This will create a nice golden brown crust when baked. Finally, evenly sprinkle almond slices on each piece. Bake for 19-25 minutes until the pastry is golden brown on the edges and crisp.

147,Roast vegetable megamix,"Preheat your oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5. Bring two large pans of salted water to the boil. Scrub the beets, then place in one of the pans - keep them separate to stop the rest of your veg turning red! Parboil for 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, peel the carrots and parsnips, then chop any bigger ones in half along with the turnips. Trim and quarter the fennel. Place the prepped veg together in the second pan and parboil for 10 minutes. Drain all the veg and leave to steam dry, then separate them out so you can hit them with those different flavours. Toss the beets with the balsamic vinegar and whole herb sprigs. Toss the carrots with the clementine juice and throw in the squeezed halves, then pick over the rosemary leaves. Toss the parsnips with the vinegar and tear over the sage leaves. Reserve the honey for later. Toss the turnips with the vinegar and bay.

152,Spinach and Artichoke Pan Pizza,"Make the dough: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and yeast. Add the water and olive oil and use a spoon or dough whisk (I have this one) to bring it together, stirring the mixture a few times to ensure there are no unmixed pockets of flour. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise until it doubles and moves a lot when jiggled, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours at room temperature. If you won’t need the dough until later, you can transfer it to the fridge a little before it’s fully doubled and let it finish there for a few hours or overnight. Assemble the pizza: Heat your oven to 450°F (230°C). Coat a 12-inch (30-cm) round cast-iron skillet or a 9×13 cake pan with 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil. Scrape dough into the pan, then turn it over once so it’s oiled on both sides. Dip your fingers in the oil to coat them and dimple the dough out to the edges as best as you can; it’s okay if it doesn’t fully stretch at this point. Set it aside, loosely covered, for 30 minutes to finish proofing. Meanwhile, make the spinach pesto: In a food processor or high-speed blender, combine the scallions and garlic. Add spinach and pulse the machine until it’s well-chopped. Drizzle in olive oil until the mixture looks thick but loosened — usually it needs 4 to 6 tablespoons. Season well with salt and red pepper flakes to taste. To assemble: Being careful not to deflate the dough, use oiled fingers to gently dimple the dough out to the edges of the pan if it’s not there already. Spoon half of the spinach pesto mixture over the dough, and use the back of the spoon to gently spread it out. The toppings should go all the way to the pan’s edge when making this pizza, i.e. do not leave an empty border. Arrange the artichoke hearts over the spinach pesto, then finely grate some of the lemon zest over. Sprinkle mozzarella, parmesan, and fontina, then season the pizza with salt, red pepper flakes, and a little more lemon zest. Bake the pizza: For 25 to 30 minutes, until deeply golden brown at the edges and toasty on top. Yes, this baking time and temperature is correct. It sounds very long but I’ve made a hundred of these pizzas and always regret when I take it out before 30 minutes, as the edges have a less satisfying crunch. To serve: Finish with lemon juice. You can serve it right in the pan, but I prefer to protect my knives and loosen the pizza from the pan and slide it onto a cutting board before cutting it into wedges or squares. Do ahead: Leftovers reheat fantastically. I heat leftover slices on a foil-covered sheet pan at 350°F or 375°F for 15 minutes. Leftover spinach pesto keeps for up to 5 days in the fridge.","Dough; 2 cups (260 grams) all-purpose flour; 1 teaspoon instant yeast; 1 teaspoon kosher salt (I use Diamond brand kosher salt; use half of other brands); 1 cup lukewarm water (100° to 115°F); 1 tablespoon (15 grams) olive oil; Spinach Pesto; 2 thick or 3 thin scallions, thinly sliced; 2 garlic cloves, minced; 4 ounces (115 grams) spinach leaves, baby spinach is fine; Red pepper flakes, to taste; Olive oil; Assembly; 1 14-ounce can quartered artichoke hearts, drained and patted dry; Zest and juice from half a lemon; 6 ounces (170 grams) mozzarella, diced from a block or perlini (as shown here); 1/2 cup (45 grams) grated parmesan; 1/2 cup (55 grams) grated fontina or asiago cheese"

Drizzle them with the olive oil, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt and pepper (save the lime juice for later). Toss until all of the ingredients are lightly coated, then arrange them in an even layer across the pan. Rearrange any single onion pieces from the outer edges to the interior of the pan, as they tend to burn otherwise. Bake the peppers and onions on the middle rack for 15 minutes.  Once the pot of water is boiling, pour in the rice. Give the mixture a brief stir and let it boil for 30 minutes, reducing the heat if necessary to prevent overflow. Drain the rice, return it to the pot, cover, and let it rest for 10 minutes off the heat.  Meanwhile, lightly pat the halloumi dry. Slice the halloumi lengthwise into pieces ¼ to ½ inch thick, then cut or tear the slabs into small, bite-sized pieces about 1-inch long. On the remaining baking sheet, drizzle the halloumi with ½ tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle all over with the optional chipotle powder. Toss until lightly coated, and arrange them in an even layer.  Once the timer goes off for the peppers, remove them from the oven, stir and redistribute. Again move any single onion pieces to the middle, then return the baking sheet to the oven. When you do that, place the pan of halloumi on the top rack. After 10 minutes, stir and flip the cheese, moving any browning pieces more toward the middle. Return it to the oven for up to 5 more minutes, keeping a close eye on it as the cheese tends to brown quickly toward the end. Continue baking the pepper mixture until the peppers and onions are tender and deeply caramelized. They are typically done around the time that the halloumi is finished.  While the peppers are hot out of the oven, drizzle the lime juice on top and stir to combine. Season to taste with additional salt and pepper. To finish the rice, fluff it with a fork, then stir in the cilantro, lime juice, and salt. Add the black beans and gently stir to combine. Cover until you’re ready to serve. To assemble, divide the rice between four bowls, followed by the pepper mixture and cheese. Finish with any desired toppings, and enjoy warm. Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 4 days.","3 bell peppers (red, orange or yellow); 1 medium red onion; 2 tablespoons olive oil ; 1 teaspoon chili powder; ½ teaspoon cumin; ½ teaspoon garlic powder; ¼ teaspoon fine salt; 10 twists of freshly ground black pepper; 2 tablespoons lime juice; ½ pound or more* halloumi cheese ; ½ tablespoon olive oil; ¼ teaspoon chipotle powder or smoked paprika (optional, for heat); 1 cup long-grain brown rice or brown basmati rice, rinsed well; 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro; 2 tablespoons lime juice; ½ teaspoon fine salt; 1 can (15 ounces) black beans, rinsed and drained, or 1 ½ cups cooked black beans; Topping suggestions: Fresh cilantro, sliced avocado or dollops of guacamole, halved cherry tomatoes, sour cream"

189,"Spinach, Sun-Dried Tomato & Basil Puff Pastry Quiche","Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Spray a 9-inch pie pan with nonstick cooking spray. Prepare the crust: On a lightly floured surface, roll out the thawed puff pastry crust so that it will fit the bottom width of your pie pan. (If it isn’t thawed yet and is completely frozen, wrap it in a paper towel and microwave for 10-15 seconds to easily thaw.) Place rolled out puff pastry in the greased pie pan, trimming any edges that go over the sides and press those back into any gaps in the pie dish so the pan is completely covered. Tuck the crust edges so that the puff pastry rests just on the pie dish but doesn’t spill over the edges of the top, otherwise it will be difficult to remove. Prepare quiche: In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, cottage cheese, milk and salt and pepper until well combined. Add spinach, sundried tomatoes and basil to the bottom of the puff pastry. Pour the egg mixture over the top. Top with shredded cheddar, crumbled feta and extra black pepper. Make the egg wash: In a small bowl, whisk together one egg. Brush the crust of the puff pastry. Bake the quiche: Add quiche to the oven and bake for 35 to 40 minutes until eggs are set and no longer jiggly (a very slightly jiggly is fine!) and puff pastry crust is golden brown. I recommend checking at about 25 to 30 minutes in to make sure your puff pastry crust isn’t getting too brown or burning. Mine was fine throughout the entire process but all ovens are unique and run at slightly different temperatures. If it is getting too brown or starting to burn, simply tent the crust with foil.","1 frozen puff pastry sheet, defrosted; 3-4 cups fresh spinach, finely chopped; ½ cup drained sun-dried tomato halves, chopped; ⅓ cup loosely packed basil leaves, chopped; 6 large eggs; ⅓ cup cottage cheese; ⅓ cup milk of choice (I suggest dairy milk or unsweetened almond milk); ½ teaspoon kosher salt; Lots of freshly ground black pepper; 2 ounces shredded sharp cheddar cheese; 2 ounces feta cheese or goat cheese, crumbled (about ½ cup); For egg wash:; 1 large egg"
190,Chicken Caesar Pasta Salad,"Prep the pasta water. Bring a large pot of generously-salted water to a boil over high heat. Cook the garlic breadcrumbs. Meanwhile, melt the butter over medium heat in a large sauté pan. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute, stirring frequently. Add the breadcrumbs along with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and sauté for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently, until golden. Transfer the breadcrumbs to a bowl and set aside. Wipe down the sauté pan briefly until clean. Cook the chicken. Season the chicken generously on both sides with salt and pepper. Using the same sauté pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the chicken and cook for 4-5 minutes per side until cooked through and no longer pink inside. Transfer the chicken to a clean cutting board and let it rest for 5-10 minutes, then thinly slice it into bite-sized pieces. Cook the pasta. Cook the pasta in the salted water until just al dente. Strain the pasta through a colander, then rinse it with cold water until chilled. Toss the pasta salad. Add the pasta, lettuce, chicken and Caesar dressing to a large mixing bowl and gently toss until evenly combined.  Serve. Serve immediately, garnished with the garlic breadcrumbs, lots of Parmesan cheese, and a few extra twists of black pepper.

191,Black Bean and Vegetable Bake,"Heat your largest ovenproof skillet or sauté pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add oil, and once the oil is hot, add the onion, garlic, jalapeño, and bell pepper and cook until the the ingredients begin to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the cumin, first 2 teaspoons chili powder, and tomato paste, and cook for 1 minute. Add diced tomatoes and let simmer for 1 minute, then add the beans and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. Taste the mixture and add salt; I find I need between 2 to 3 teaspoons of kosher salt (Diamond brand) to get the level right but adjust it to your taste. Add last 1 teaspoon chili powder if needed for your desired heat level. Add the corn and spinach and stir until the spinach has wilted and everything is warm. Taste for seasoning again and adjust as needed. Squeeze juice of half a lime over. Meanwhile, heat your oven’s broiler, and if it doesn’t have a broiler, heat it as hot as it goes. If your skillet isn’t ovenproof, pour mixture into a baking dish. Mix jack and cotija cheeses and sprinkle mixture over the beans. [The smaller amount of jack cheese covers the pan less thickly than shown here, and allows more sauce to bubble through. The larger amount is never unwelcome.] Transfer to broiler and cook until cheese is melted and browned on top. Eat right away with tortilla chips, hot sauce of your choice, and if you’re me, a squeeze of juice from the second half of the lime. Do ahead: While the whole dish reheats well in a 350°F oven, if you’re planning to eat it later, I’d wait to put the cheese on until right before you serve it because cheese is at its most stretchy/gooey the first time it melts.","2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil; 1 large onion, diced small; 4 cloves of garlic, minced; 1 fresh jalapeño or habanero pepper, minced; 1 bell pepper, diced; 1 teaspoon ground cumin; 2 to 3 teaspoons ground chili powder (to taste); 2 tablespoons tomato paste; 1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes, or 2 to 3 cans Rotel; Kosher salt; 2 (15.5-ounce) cans black beans, drained and rinsed; Kosher salt; 1 cup corn kernels, fresh (from 1 ear), canned and drained, or frozen (no need to thaw); 4 ounces baby spinach, roughly chopped; 1 lime, halved; 3/4 cup crumbled cotija cheese; 6 to 8 ounces (1 1/2 to 2 cups) coarsely grated monterey jack or pepper jack cheese; Tortilla chips"
192,"Kale, Edamame, and Quinoa Salad with Lemon Vinaigrette","First, cook your quinoa: Add quinoa and water to a medium pot and place over high heat; bring to a boil, then cover, reduce heat to low and cook for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, remove from heat, fluff quinoa with a fork and transfer quinoa to a large bowl to cool down. To make dressing: place olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, dijon, honey (or agave), basil, and salt and pepper in blender. Pulse for 10-15 seconds; set aside. You can also whisk in a small bowl if you don't have a blender (just make sure your basil is very finely chopped.) In large bowl add your kale and pour half of the dressing over. Use clean hands to massage the kale for about 3 minutes or until it breaks down. This allows the kale to take on the dressing flavors. Next add in quinoa, edamame, diced onion, and remaining lemon vinaigrette; toss so that the salad is fully coated. Before serving, toss salad again and add tomatoes, mango and avocado. Sprinkle toasted sliced almonds over the top. Serves 4.

193,Little cherry and chestnut chocolate brownies,"Brownies are absolutely gorgeous. I’ve used cherries and chestnuts in mine – although it may not seem like the most obvious pairing, the chocolate makes them friends and I think they complement each other well. Arrange on boards or plates around the room for people to pick at; there won’t be any left over! Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Line a 20cm x 30cm baking tin with greaseproof paper. In a bowl over a pan of simmering water, melt the butter and the chocolate, mixing gently until smooth. Stir in the cherries and chestnuts then remove from the heat. In a separate bowl, mix the cocoa powder, flour, baking powder and sugar. Add this to your melted chocolate mixture then stir until it’s all combined really well. Beat your eggs then mix these in, too. Pour this brownie mix into the baking tin, and place in the oven for around 15 to 20 minutes. You don’t want to overcook it, so you don’t want a skewer to come out clean. The brownie should be slightly springy on the outside but gooey in the middle. Allow them to cool in the tray for 30 minutes then carefully turn them out on to a chopping board and cut into 3cm squares. Pile them on plates and dust with icing sugar. Serve with bowls of crème fraîche, with orange zest grated over.","175 g unsalted butter; 200 g good-quality dark chocolate (70% cocoa solids) , broken up; 75 g dried cherries; 75 g roasted chestnuts , chopped; 75 g cocoa powder , sifted; 100 g plain flour , sifted; 1 teaspoon baking powder; 300 g golden caster sugar; 4 large free-range eggs; icing sugar , for dusting; 500 ml crème fraîche , to serve; 1 orange , zest of, to serve"
194,Red Lentil Soup,"Heat 2 Tablespoons oil in a large pan and sauté the onions for 3-5 minutes or until almost golden. Add half the minced garlic and sauté for 30 seconds then add the minced tomatoes, jalapeno, tomato paste and spices. Sauté for 2-3 minutes then stir in the lentils and water. The mixture may seem watery but it will thicken as it cooks and rests. You may need to add more water later as needed. Cover and cook down for 15 minutes or until lentils are cooked through. Using an immersion blender, half blend the mixture for a few seconds until half creamy. Alternatively, transfer half the mixture to a blender and blend for 30 seconds. Top with the chopped dill and half the minced cilantro. In a separate pan, sauté remaining minced garlic and cilantro in 2 Tablespoons olive oil and 1 Tablespoon butter, for 1-2 minutes or until the garlic begins to develop a golden color. Add the mixture to the lentil soup and stir to combine. Serve in soup bowls with lemon wedges and pita chips or fried pita bread bites (see below). To make pita bread bites, slice a pita bread into small squares and fry in hot oil for 1 minute or until golden brown. Remove onto a paper towel-lined plate."," 4 tbsp olive oil, divided;  1 small onion, finely chopped;  6 cloves garlic, finely minced, divided;  1 cup fresh tomato, minced;  1 small jalapeno or serrano pepper, diced;  2 Tablespoons tomato paste;  1 1/2 teaspoons EACH cumin powder, coriander powder, salt;  ½ teaspoon EACH curry powder, chili powder, black pepper;  1 cup red lentils;  5 cups boiling water;  ¼ cup dill, finely minced;  ½ cup cilantro, finely minced;  1 Tablespoon butter;  Fresh lemon juice;  Pita chips or fried pita bites;  Fresh parsley"
195,One Pot Creamy Pesto Chicken Pasta,"Cut the chicken breast into 1-inch pieces. Add the butter to a deep skillet and melt over medium heat. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook over medium heat until the chicken is slightly browned on the outside. While the chicken is cooking, mince the garlic.

200,Blistered Peas-in-the-Pod with Lemon and Salt,"Wash and pat dry the fresh peas in their pods. Toss in a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil. Heat your grill to a medium-high temperature. Use tongs to arrange the pea pods across grill grates so they don’t fall in. Grill for about 5 minutes on the first side, until blistered and dark in spots underneath. Flip pea pods over and repeat on second side, another 5 minutes, adding another minute or two if needed. [Note: My grill is small and fairly weak. This might take less time on a more robust grill. Look for blistering, not a measured amount of time.] Transfer grilled peas to a serving plate. Season with salt, pepper, and lemon zest; nestle lemon wedges on the plate for those who want fresh juice on theirs. There are two ways to serve these:Edamame-style: Serve in the closed pods, just like this, to be eaten “edamame-style” — i.e. holding the pod in your hand and popping the peas into your mouth, discarding the pod.Raft-style: Alternatively, you can peel open the pods, exposing the row of peas inside. With this method, I season the insides as well with salt, pepper, and zest. Add the optional extras of mint and crumbled cheese. Serve hot or warm.

202,Pork Lumpia,"Brown the ground pork in a skillet over medium heat until fully cooked through. Let cool slightly. Drain the grease and using a mesh strainer, press out any of the excess liquid. Set aside and let cool to room temperature. Place the shredded cabbage and carrot in a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped, but not pulsed into a paste. In a large bowl, add the ground pork, pulsed vegetables, garlic, soy sauce and salt. Stir until well combined. Make the corn starch paste. In a small bowl, stir the corn starch with the water until dissolved. Heat in the microwave for 25 seconds and then stir again. Take one spring roll wrapper and place on a work surface. Place a small spoonful of the filling near the middle of the wrapper but a little closer to you. Lift the corner of the wrapper by you over the filling and slightly tuck it under.  Start to roll the lumpia away from you, forming it into a small log top shape. Fold the side corners into the lumpia and tuck them under as you continue to roll. Try to roll tightly but be careful not to let the wrapper tear. At the point when the lumpia is mostly rolled with just the top corner of the wrapper showing, dip a finger into the corn starch paste. Rub that on the top corner of the wrapper which serves as an adhesive. Continue to roll the lumpia over the final corner of the wrapper. Because of the corn starch mixture, the corner should stick easily and seal the lumpia. Heat oil in a deep fryer to 375F. Fry the lumpia in batches, around 6-8 at a time. Fry until the lumpia are a nice golden brown. This should take 3-4 minutes. Remove from the deep fryer and place on a couple pieces of paper towel to absorb any of the excess oil. Continue to fry the lumpia.

Place a large non-stick saucepan over a medium heat and pour in a lug of oil. Add the onions, coriander stalks and jalapeño and sauté for 10 minutes, until softened but not coloured. Stir in the coriander seeds, fry for a couple more minutes, then add the lentils. Stir in 800ml boiling water and bring back to the boil. Season well, reduce the heat, pop on the lid and simmer for 40 minutes, until the lentils are cooked and beginning to break down. Blacken the peppers by either placing them directly on a gas flame, or griddling them in a griddle pan, turning regularly until blackened all over. Pop them in a bowl, cover with clingfilm and let stand. After about 5 minutes the peppers should be ready, so flake away the blistered skin and remove the stalk and seeds. Slice the flesh into thin strips and leave to one side. Place the chipotle chilli in a small bowl and pour in just enough boiling water to cover. After a few minutes, it should have softened; carefully remove from the bowl and finely chop. Place a medium-sized pan over a medium heat and pour in a lug of olive oil. Add the garlic and all the chillies and fry for 1 minute, then add the peppers and paprika. Fry for a few more minutes, then add the tomatoes. Season well and gradually bring everything to a simmer.

207,Creamy Lemon Zucchini Pasta,"Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt heavily. Meanwhile, place a clean kitchen towel in a large bowl (or on a large cutting board). Trim 2 lb. zucchini or summer squash (4–6), then grate on the large holes of a box grater directly into towel. Peel 1 large shallot and grate on the large holes of grater into towel. Peel 4 large garlic cloves and grate on the small holes of grater into towel. Gather ends of towel together, then squeeze over bowl (or the sink) with all your might to extract water from the zucchini. Squeeze until it’s hard to get out any more liquid. You should have extracted about ⅔ cup zucchini liquid, just FYI; discard. Heat 3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a medium Dutch oven or very large skillet over medium-high. Add ¼ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add zucchini mixture (unwrap the balled-up towel over the pot for easiest transfer) and 2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt and stir to coat. Season generously with freshly ground black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until zucchini mixture is jammy, thick, and starting to stick to bottom of pot, 15–20 minutes. When the zucchini has been cooking 5–10 minutes, add 12 oz. spaghetti, linguine, bucatini, or other long pasta to pot of boiling water and cook until al dente. Meanwhile, juice 1 lemon into a small bowl. Grate ½ oz. Parmesan on the small holes of grater (you should have about ¼ cup; you can also use ¼ cup pre-grated Parmesan). Very coarsely tear or chop ½ cup (lightly packed) basil or mint leaves. Scoop out 2 cups pasta cooking water and set aside. Using tongs, transfer pasta to pot with zucchini—it’s okay if some water clings to it. Reduce heat to medium-low, add ½ cup pasta cooking liquid and ½ cup heavy cream, and stir to combine. Add cheese, pour another ½ cup pasta cooking liquid over top, and cook, stirring vigorously with tongs or a wooden spoon and add more pasta cooking liquid if needed, until a creamy sauce that coats pasta forms, 2–3 minutes. Remove pasta from heat and stir in 2 Tbsp. lemon juice. Taste and season with more salt and black pepper and add more lemon juice (you may want to add an additional 1 Tbsp.). Stir in most of the herbs. Serve pasta topped with more grated Parmesan and remaining herbs. Editor’s note: This zucchini pasta recipe was first printed online in August 2020.

224,Spinach and Artichoke Pan Pizza,"Make the dough: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and yeast. Add the water and olive oil and use a spoon or dough whisk (I have this one) to bring it together, stirring the mixture a few times to ensure there are no unmixed pockets of flour. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise until it doubles and moves a lot when jiggled, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours at room temperature. If you won’t need the dough until later, you can transfer it to the fridge a little before it’s fully doubled and let it finish there for a few hours or overnight. Assemble the pizza: Heat your oven to 450°F (230°C). Coat a 12-inch (30-cm) round cast-iron skillet or a 9×13 cake pan with 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil. Scrape dough into the pan, then turn it over once so it’s oiled on both sides. Dip your fingers in the oil to coat them and dimple the dough out to the edges as best as you can; it’s okay if it doesn’t fully stretch at this point. Set it aside, loosely covered, for 30 minutes to finish proofing. Meanwhile, make the spinach pesto: In a food processor or high-speed blender, combine the scallions and garlic. Add spinach and pulse the machine until it’s well-chopped. Drizzle in olive oil until the mixture looks thick but loosened — usually it needs 4 to 6 tablespoons. Season well with salt and red pepper flakes to taste. To assemble: Being careful not to deflate the dough, use oiled fingers to gently dimple the dough out to the edges of the pan if it’s not there already. Spoon half of the spinach pesto mixture over the dough, and use the back of the spoon to gently spread it out. The toppings should go all the way to the pan’s edge when making this pizza, i.e. do not leave an empty border. Arrange the artichoke hearts over the spinach pesto, then finely grate some of the lemon zest over. Sprinkle mozzarella, parmesan, and fontina, then season the pizza with salt, red pepper flakes, and a little more lemon zest. Bake the pizza: For 25 to 30 minutes, until deeply golden brown at the edges and toasty on top. Yes, this baking time and temperature is correct. It sounds very long but I’ve made a hundred of these pizzas and always regret when I take it out before 30 minutes, as the edges have a less satisfying crunch. To serve: Finish with lemon juice. You can serve it right in the pan, but I prefer to protect my knives and loosen the pizza from the pan and slide it onto a cutting board before cutting it into wedges or squares. Do ahead: Leftovers reheat fantastically. I heat leftover slices on a foil-covered sheet pan at 350°F or 375°F for 15 minutes. Leftover spinach pesto keeps for up to 5 days in the fridge.","Dough; 2 cups (260 grams) all-purpose flour; 1 teaspoon instant yeast; 1 teaspoon kosher salt (I use Diamond brand kosher salt; use half of other brands); 1 cup lukewarm water (100° to 115°F); 1 tablespoon (15 grams) olive oil; Spinach Pesto; 2 thick or 3 thin scallions, thinly sliced; 2 garlic cloves, minced; 4 ounces (115 grams) spinach leaves, baby spinach is fine; Red pepper flakes, to taste; Olive oil; Assembly; 1 14-ounce can quartered artichoke hearts, drained and patted dry; Zest and juice from half a lemon; 6 ounces (170 grams) mozzarella, diced from a block or perlini (as shown here); 1/2 cup (45 grams) grated parmesan; 1/2 cup (55 grams) grated fontina or asiago cheese"

Transfer to a large jar or plastic container. Leave the lid ajar for 1 hr or so in a warm place, then seal and set aside for 24 hrs. For the next six days, you will need to ‘feed’ it. Each day, tip away half the original starter, add an extra 25g of each flour and 50ml slightly warm water, and stir well. After a few days, you should start to see bubbles on the surface, and it will smell yeasty. On day seven, the starter should be bubbly and smell much sweeter. It is now ready to be used, but make sure you keep half back and carry on feeding for your next loaf.  Tip both the flours, 300ml warm water and the starter into a bowl, stir with a wooden spoon into a dough and leave somewhere for an hour.  Tip in 25ml more water and the salt and bring everything together. Cover and leave somewhere warm for 3 hrs, folding the dough onto itself several times in the first hour.

Halve the cherry tomatoes, halve, deseed and roughly chop the pepper, and trim and cut the courgette into half lengthways then into 2cm chunks. Add it all to a large roasting tray, making a little well in the middle of the veg. Drain the ricotta and place it in the middle, with the largest side facing down. Zest ½ a lemon over the ricotta and pour over half of the flavoured oil. Toss the rest of the oil with the mixed veggies. Add a splash of water to the tray, then roast for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the tomatoes and veg are soft and just starting to caramelise.

Add the garlic, chili powder, salt, cumin and sauté, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes.  Mash the black bean filling. Scoot the veggie mixture to the edges of the pan and add the black beans and beer (or vegetable broth) to the empty space in the middle. Use a potato masher to gently mash most of the beans. Fold the veggie mixture into the black beans until evenly combined. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper if needed. (If the mixture seems too dry, you can also add in an extra splash of beer.) Assemble the tacos. Add about ⅓ cup of the black bean filling and a sprinkling of shredded cheese to each tortilla and gently fold in half to close.

243,Coconut Ice Cream Sandwiches With Salty Chocolate Shell,"Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350°. Beat ¾ cup (packed; 150 g) light brown sugar and ½ cup (1 stick) room-temperature unsalted butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or a large bowl if using a hand mixer) on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl with a rubber spatula and beat again to combine. Add 1 large egg and 1 tsp. dark rum or vanilla extract and beat until combined and fluffy. Whisk 1¼ cups (156 g) all-purpose flour, 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut, 1 tsp. baking soda, and 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a medium bowl to combine. Add dry ingredients to brown sugar mixture all at once and mix on low speed until well combined. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl with spatula and beat again to incorporate. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Using cookie scoop, scoop 12 heaping rounds onto prepared baking sheets, spacing about 2"" apart. (If you don’t have a #40 scoop, make each cookie about 2 Tbsp.) Bake cookies, rotating front to back and top to bottom after 5 minutes, until edges are golden and solid but centers are still a little underbaked, 11–13 minutes. Remove cookies from oven and smack baking sheet hard on counter a couple of times—be firm! This will cause the cookies to collapse in the center and keep them chewy. Let cookies cool on baking sheets, then gently transfer all of the cookies to 1 baking sheet, arranging in a single layer. Chill cookies in the freezer until cold and firm, about 15 minutes. While cookies are chilling, let 1 pint vanilla or coconut ice cream sit on counter at room temperature until pliable (but before it’s melted), 10–15 minutes. Scoop a heaping ¼ cup ice cream onto bottoms of 6 cookies. Top with remaining 6 cookies, bottoms facing down. Gently press sandwiches together until ice cream is even and almost at the edge all the way around. Chill ice cream sandwiches in the freezer until firm and set up, at least 10 minutes. Pour 2 cups water into a medium saucepan and set a medium heatproof bowl on top of pan. Bring water to a simmer over medium-high heat. Combine 2 cups bittersweet chocolate chips, ¼ cup refined coconut oil, and ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt in bowl and heat, stirring occasionally with a clean spatula, until chips are melted and combined. Remove from heat and keep chocolate shell mixture warm over water. (You can also melt chocolate shell mixture in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave at medium-high power in 20-second increments.) Remove cookies from freezer and, working one at a time, dip half of each sandwich in chocolate shell. (Store any extra chocolate shell in the refrigerator—it keeps almost indefinitely and can be reheated for ice cream sundaes or as dip for fruit, cookies, and even potato chips.) Place sandwiches back on baking sheet and sprinkle with flaky sea salt as you go. Chill in freezer until set before serving, at least 15 minutes. Do ahead: Ice cream sandwiches can be made 1 month ahead. Transfer to an airtight container, stacking with sheets of parchment paper between each layer, and freeze.","¾ cup (packed; 150 g) light brown sugar; ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature; 1 large egg; 1 tsp. dark rum or vanilla extract; 1¼ cups (156 g) all-purpose flour; 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut; 1 tsp. baking soda; 1 tsp.

245,Perfect Blueberry Muffin Loaf,"Heat oven to 375°F. Line a loaf pan (see Note up top about size) with one big piece of parchment paper pressed into the corners and up the sides, as shown here. I leave the excess paper extended up over the rim, which also helps protect you against overflow. Melt butter in a large bowl, then whisk in granulated sugar and zest. Add yogurt and eggs and whisk to evenly combine. Sprinkle surface of batter with baking powder, baking soda, and salt and whisk thoroughly into the batter, several times more around the bowl than is necessary for it to look mixed. Add flour and berries and use a flexible spatula or spoon to mix them in so that no pockets of flour remain. Batter will be very, very thick. Spoon into prepared loaf pan and drop it on the counter a few times to make sure there no air pockets. Smooth the top and sprinkle it with turbinado sugar. It will seem like way too much but I beg you not to skimp at all; the batter is not very sweet but the crunchy top the sugar provides is one of the best parts. Bake for 60 to 70 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into a few places in the loaf come out batter-free. If your berries were frozen going in, this might even need 5 additional minutes. Remove from oven and let cool in pan. Use parchment paper to lift it out of the pan and cut into thick slices. Do ahead: I use the parchment paper to transfer leftovers back to the loaf pan. Store at room temperature for 3 to 4 days, longer in the fridge. I keep the loaf uncovered/unwrapped which allows the top to retain its crunch. The sides are kept from drying out by the parchment and loaf. The loaf freezes well, wrapped tightly. P.S. Yes, of course you can use any other kind of berry here. I tested a few rounds with frozen mixed berry mixes, and as long as the strawberries aren’t comically huge (I chopped ones that were), it works great.","8 tablespoons (1/2 cup or 115 grams) unsalted butter, cold is fine; 3/4 cup (150 grams) granulated sugar; Finely grated zest from one lemon; 1 cup (225 grams) plain unsweetened Greek-style yogurt; 2 large eggs; 2 teaspoons baking powder; 1/2 teaspoon baking soda; 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt; 2 cups (260 grams) all-purpose flour; 2 1/4 cups (320 grams or 11.5 ounces) fresh or frozen blueberries (no need to defrost); 3 tablespoons (35 grams) turbinado sugar (sugar in the raw)"

After the chicken has cooked for about 5 minutes, lift the lid and turn the chicken breasts over. Close the lid and let the chicken cook some more. The chicken is finished cooking when the meat has an internal temperature of 165F, when checked with a digital thermometer. Grilling boneless skinless chicken breast takes about 12-15 minutes, but can vary depending on the size and thickness of the meat.  Remove from the grill and let the chicken breast rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the juices to draw back into the centre of the meat. Serve with tzatziki, greek salad, and rice.","4 boneless skinless chicken breasts; 1/3 cup olive oil; 1/4 cup red wine vinegar; 2 tbsp lemon juice; 4 garlic cloves, minced; 1 tbsp oregano; 2 tsp thyme; 1 tsp salt; 1 tsp ground black pepper"

Blanch your broccoli florets and sliced stalks really quickly in boiling salted water for 60 seconds, just long enough to soften the broccoli but still leave it with a bit of a bite. Drain it in a colander, then spread it around a clean tea towel to steam dry (this is important because it will help the dressing cling to the broccoli). Once completely dry, transfer to a serving dish. Finely slice the bacon and fry on a medium heat with a small splash of olive oil until crisp and golden, then spoon most of the bacon bits over your broccoli.

275,Easy No-Bake Granola Bars,"Line a 9-inch square baker with two strips of criss-crossed parchment paper, cut to fit neatly against the base and up the sides. The parchment paper will make it easy for you to slice the bars later. Place the oats in a large mixing bowl**. Add the cinnamon and salt, and stir to combine. Set aside. Now we’ll blitz the mix-ins briefly in the food processor or blender (or, you can chop them by hand). Add any large nuts (like almonds or pecans) first and blitz for a few seconds. Then add the rest and run the machine for a few more seconds, until the ingredients are all broken up into pieces smaller than your pinky nail. Pour the mix-ins into the bowl of oats. 
In a 2-cup liquid measuring cup, measure out the nut butter. Top with ½ cup honey and the vanilla extract. Stir until well blended. If you must, you can gently warm the liquid mixture on the stovetop or in the microwave, but make sure it’s close to room temperature before you pour it into the dry mixture (this is especially important if using chocolate, since it will melt).
 
Pour the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients. Use a big spoon to mix them together until the two are evenly combined and no dry oats remain. This takes some arm muscles, but you can do it! If the mixture was easy to mix together, that’s a sign that you need to add some more oats—sprinkle in more oats until you can’t incorporate any more.
 
Transfer the mixture to the prepared square baker. Use your spoon to arrange the mixture fairly evenly in the baker, then use the bottom of a flat, round surface (like a short, sturdy drinking glass) to pack the mixture down as firmly and evenly as possible.
 
Cover the baker and refrigerate for at least one hour, or preferably overnight. (The oats need time to soak up some of the moisture so they aren’t sticky.) When you’re ready to slice, lift the bars out of the baker by grabbing both pieces of parchment paper on opposite corners. Use a sharp knife to slice the bars into 4 even columns and 4 even rows.
 
Wrap individual bars in plastic wrap or parchment paper (if you store them all together, they will stick to one another). Bars keep well for several days at room temperature, a couple of weeks in the fridge, or several months in a freezer-safe bag in the freezer for best flavor.

278,Jalapeño Popper Stuffed Smoked Pork Tenderloin Wrapped in Bacon,"Trim the pork tenderloins of any fat and membrane. Holding knife horizontally, slice the pork tenderloin in half being careful not to pierce through the other end. In a small bowl, mix together the jalapeño pepper with the cream cheese, cheddar cheese and chili powder. Spread the cheese and jalapeño pepper mixture evenly in the openings of the pork tenderloin. Close up the tenderloins ensuring that the cheese stays inside the pocket of the meat. Wrap the tenderloins with the bacon and place on smoker rack. It may be wise to have the tenderloins with the cut open side facing up, so that any melted cheese will stay in the pocket and not ooze out. Set the smoker to 275F using wood of choice (hickory, apple or cherry work great). Smoke the pork until they reach an internal temperature of 165F and the bacon is rendered and starting to crisp, approximately 2 1/2 - 3 hours. Remove the pork tenderloins from the smoker and let them rest for about 10 minutes. Slice into 1 inch medallions and serve.","2 pork tenderloin; 4 jalapeno peppers, cored and minced; 8 oz cream cheese; 1 cup cheddar cheese, grated; 1 tbsp chili powder; 10-12 bacon slices"
279,Smash burgers,"Slice the burger buns in half, then toast or grill the cut sides and set aside. Heat the oven to 100C/80C fan/gas ¼. Divide the mince into four loose piles and season generously with salt. Heat ¼ tbsp oil in a heavy frying pan or skillet over a high heat and put one of the piles in the pan. Working quickly, cover with a square of baking parchment and use a second smaller pan to press the beef patty down as hard as you can (you may wear oven gloves or use the end of a rolling pin for pressing down, being careful of the heat and rising steam). Allow to cook for 2 mins. Remove the parchment and turn the patty over. Press down with a spatula, cover with a slice of cheese and cook for 1 min. Transfer to a baking tray and keep warm in the oven while you cook the other burgers in the same way. To assemble the burger, scatter a bun base with onion, lettuce and tomato slices, followed by a smashed patty, gherkin slices and the bun top. Serve with your chosen sauces on the side.","4 burger buns, sesame topped or brioche, whichever you prefer ; 1 tbsp sunflower oil; 500g steak mince, 15-20% fat is good ; 4 slices mild cheddar, or burger cheese; 1 red onion, finely sliced; handfuls of iceberg lettuce, finely shredded; 2 tomatoes, sliced ; 1 large gherkin, sliced lengthways; mayonnaise, ketchup and American mustard, or your preferred sauces, to serve "
280,Rainbow Grilled Cheese Sandwich,"Gather the ingredients. Divide cheese evenly between 4 bowls. Add a squirt of food coloring to 1 bowl and stir it with a fork until coated and colorful. Repeat this step, using different colors, for each of the other bowls until you have your desired colors. Feel free to go a little wild here and combine colors that are analogous to each other. Add colored cheese to piece of bread, in the form of individual lines so that the colors aren't overlapping. This will create the desired rainbow effect. Once the lines of colored cheese take up the entire surface of the bread, add the other piece of bread on top, close sandwich, and butter the outside. In a medium-sized pan, add buttered grilled cheese and cook for a few minutes until bread turns a golden brown and all the cheese has begun to melt. Flip sandwich and repeat until both sides are golden brown and all the cheese has melted. Remove from heat, cut against your original cheese lines, and serve.",2 slices bread; 1/3 cup shredded white cheese; 1 package neon food coloring; 1 tablespoon salted butter
281,Watermelon Salad,"In a small bowl, combine the sliced shallot with the vinegar and fine salt. Toss to combine, and place in the refrigerator to lightly pickle while you prepare the remaining ingredients (at least 10 minutes). Spread the cubed watermelon over a large platter or shallow serving bowl. Arrange the pickled shallot on top, and spoon the leftover vinegar over the salad. Sprinkle the feta and pistachios on top.  Drizzle the olive oil all over. Finish the salad with a sprinkle of fresh herbs and flaky salt. This salad is best enjoyed within an hour or two, but will keep in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.","1 medium-to-large shallot or ½ small red onion, sliced very thinly (about ½ cup); 3 tablespoons sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar; ¼ teaspoon fine salt; 3 pounds ripe seedless watermelon (about ½ small round watermelon or 4 cups cubed), cut into ¾″ cubes; ½ cup crumbled feta (about 2 ounces); ⅓ cup roasted and salted pistachios, chopped; ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil; Small handful of fresh mint and/or basil leaves, torn if large, for garnish; Flaky salt or kosher salt, to taste"
282,Chocolate Peanut Butter and Jelly Cups,"Line a mini muffin tray with 24 mini muffin liners and make space for it in the fridge. Set aside. Melt Chocolate: Break chocolate (if using a bar) into small pieces. Melt the chocolate in the microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between each interval, just until melted. Alternatively, melt over a double boiler. In a medium saucepan, bring about 1 cup of water to simmer over low heat. Place a glass bowl on top of the pot so it rests above the simmering water, but doesn't touch it! Place chocolate chips in the bowl and allow the steam to heat the bowl. Stir occasionally until the chocolate chips are melted. Once melted, turn off the heat. Drizzle 1 tsp of melted chocolate into each mini muffin case. Rotate the muffin tin around to coat the sides of the muffin liner. You can also do this with a spoon. Try to get the chocolate as high as you can get so it can form a shell around the Peanut Butter & Jelly. After you have coated all the liners, transfer the tray to the freezer for about 5 minutes to set. After the shells have hardened, add about ½ tsp of peanut butter into the middle of each case followed by about ½ teaspoon of jelly. Add about 1 tsp of the remaining melted chocolate into each liner, making sure to cover with chocolate. Sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt if desired. Return to the freeze to set for another 5-10 minutes. Enjoy immediately."," 8 oz dark chocolate;  ¼ cup smooth peanut butter;  ¼ cup jelly or jam of choice;  Flaked or coarse salt, optional"
283,Homemade Bread,"Prepare the dough: In a large bowl or stand mixer add the yeast, water and a pinch of the sugar or honey. Allow to rest for 5-10 minutes until foaming and bubbly. (This is called “proofing” the yeast, to make sure it is active. If it doesn’t foam, the yeast is no good, and you need to start over with fresh yeast). Add remaining sugar or honey, salt, oil, and 3 cups of flour. Mix to combine. Add another cup of flour and mix to combine. With the mixer running add more flour, ½ cup at a time, until the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl. The dough should be smooth and elastic, and slightly stick to a clean finger, but not be overly sticky. Add a little more flour, if needed. Knead the dough: Mix the dough for 4-5 minutes on medium speed (or knead with your hands on a lightly floured surface, for 5-8 minutes).  First Rise: Grease a large bowl with oil or cooking spray and place the dough inside, turning to coat. Cover with a dish towel or plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm place* until doubled in size, about 1 ½ hours. Spray two 9x5'' bread pans generously with cooking spray on all sides. (I also like to line the bottom of the pans with a small piece of parchment or wax paper, but this is optional.) Punch the dough down well to remove air bubbles. Divide into two equal portions. Shape each ball into long logs and place into greased loaf pans. Second rise: Cover pans with a lightweight, dry dish towel (or spray two pieces of plastic wrap generously with cooking spray and lay them gently over the pans). Allow dough to rise again for about 45 minutes to one hour, or until risen about 1 inch above the loaf pans. Gently removing covering. Bake: Preheat oven to 350 F. Bake bread for about 30-33 minutes, or until golden brown on top. Give the top of a loaf a gentle tap; it should sound hollow. Invert the loaves onto a wire cooling rack. Brush the tops with butter and allow to cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing. Once cool, store in an airtight container or bag for 2-3 days at room temperature, or up to 5 days in the refrigerator.",2 cups warm water (105-115 degrees); 1 Tablespoons active dry yeast*; 1/4 cup honey or sugar; 2 teaspoons salt; 2 Tablespoons oil (canola or vegetable); 4 - 5 1/2 cups all-purpose or bread flour*

285,Claudio's aubergine parmigiana,"Peel the aubergine using a speed-peeler, then very finely slice the skin into matchsticks and reserve for later. Slice the aubergine into ½cm-thick rounds – if you want to be really precise, use a circular cutter (roughly 7cm in diameter) to trim the slices into perfect discs – then season with sea salt. Whisk the eggs in a shallow bowl with a small pinch of salt and black pepper, and put the flour into another shallow bowl. Pour ½cm of olive oil into a large frying pan and heat gently over a medium heat. Working in batches, coat in the aubergine discs in flour, shaking off any excess, then gently drop into the beaten egg, letting any excess drip off, and carefully place into the hot oil. Fry for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until golden and crisp, then remove to kitchen paper to drain, and repeat with the remaining discs. For the tomato sauce, drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil into a pan over a medium heat. Peel and finely slice the garlic, along with the basil stalks and fry for 2 minutes, or until lightly golden. Scrunch the tomatoes into the pan through your clean hands, then season to perfection with a pinch of salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down to low and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until thickened and reduced. Finely slice half the basil leaves and stir them through the sauce a few minutes before the end, then remove from the heat and season to taste. When the aubergine discs are all fried, turn the heat up to high and fry the aubergine skin for 1 to 2 minutes, or until super-crisp, then drain on kitchen paper. Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. To assemble, get yourself 4 small ovenproof dishes. Peel, then slice the scamorza into ½cm-thick slices. Add a spoonful of sauce to the bottom of each dish, place a slice of aubergine on top, followed by spoon of tomato sauce, a slice of scamorza and a little buffalo mozzarella. Sprinkle with a little oregano, and tear over a few basil leaves. Repeat the layers twice more, finishing with a layer of aubergine and a good grating of Parmesan.

Add the diced onion to the remaining bacon grease and sauté until tender (about 5 minutes). Add the frozen peas and about ¼ cup of the reserved pasta water to the skillet. Continue to cook and stir until the peas have heated through. Add the drained pasta to the skillet, stir to combine, and remove from the heat.

288,Greek salad,"I think it’s quite nice to have different shapes and sizes in a salad, so cut your medium tomato into wedges, halve the cherry tomatoes and slice the beef tomato into large rounds. Put all the tomatoes into a large salad bowl. Slice the onion very finely so it’s wafer thin and add to the tomatoes. Scratch a fork down the sides of the cucumber so it leaves deep grooves in the skin, then cut it into thick slices. Deseed your pepper, slice it into rings and add them to the salad along with the cucumber. Roughly chop the dill and most of the mint leaves, reserving the smaller ones for garnish. Add the chopped herbs to the bowl of salad, then squeeze your handful of olives over so they season the vegetables, then drop them in. Add a pinch of sea salt, the vinegar and the extra virgin olive oil. Quickly toss everything together with your hands. The minute all those flavours start working with the veg is when the magic starts to happen. Have a taste, and adjust the flavours if need be. To serve, pop the block of feta right on the top of the salad. Sprinkle the oregano over the top along with the reserved mint leaves, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and take it straight to the table. It’s confident and scruffy with a bit of attitude. Delicious. PS I’ve been known to pop leftover Greek salad into a liquidizer with a splash of extra virgin olive oil and a few ice cubes, then blitz it up to a smooth consistency so it's basically a Greek gazpacho. It’s not a classic thing to do, but it is very delicious, not to mention a great way of using up leftovers!","1 medium ripe tomato; 200 g ripe cherry tomatoes; 1 beef tomato; 1 medium red onion , peeled; 1 cucumber; 1 green pepper; 1 handful fresh dill; 1 handful fresh mint leaves; 1 large handful black olives , stoned; 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar; 3 tablespoons good-quality Greek extra virgin olive oil; 200 g block feta cheese; 1 teaspoon dried oregano"

Add the cumin, first 2 teaspoons chili powder, and tomato paste, and cook for 1 minute. Add diced tomatoes and let simmer for 1 minute, then add the beans and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes.

Add last 1 teaspoon chili powder if needed for your desired heat level. Add the corn and spinach and stir until the spinach has wilted and everything is warm. Taste for seasoning again and adjust as needed. Squeeze juice of half a lime over. Meanwhile, heat your oven’s broiler, and if it doesn’t have a broiler, heat it as hot as it goes. If your skillet isn’t ovenproof, pour mixture into a baking dish. Mix jack and cotija cheeses and sprinkle mixture over the beans. [The smaller amount of jack cheese covers the pan less thickly than shown here, and allows more sauce to bubble through. The larger amount is never unwelcome.] Transfer to broiler and cook until cheese is melted and browned on top. Eat right away with tortilla chips, hot sauce of your choice, and if you’re me, a squeeze of juice from the second half of the lime. Do ahead: While the whole dish reheats well in a 350°F oven, if you’re planning to eat it later, I’d wait to put the cheese on until right before you serve it because cheese is at its most stretchy/gooey the first time it melts.","2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil; 1 large onion, diced small; 4 cloves of garlic, minced; 1 fresh jalapeño or habanero pepper, minced; 1 bell pepper, diced; 1 teaspoon ground cumin; 2 to 3 teaspoons ground chili powder (to taste); 2 tablespoons tomato paste; 1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes, or 2 to 3 cans Rotel; Kosher salt; 2 (15.5-ounce) cans black beans, drained and rinsed; Kosher salt; 1 cup corn kernels, fresh (from 1 ear), canned and drained, or frozen (no need to thaw); 4 ounces baby spinach, roughly chopped; 1 lime, halved; 3/4 cup crumbled cotija cheese; 6 to 8 ounces (1 1/2 to 2 cups) coarsely grated monterey jack or pepper jack cheese; Tortilla chips"
293,Ridiculously Good Air Fryer Salmon,"Prep the salmon: Remove the skin from your salmon, if it has skin. Pat with paper towels so the surface is mostly dry. Cut your salmon into cubes, 1 to 2 inches each (see photo). Prep the spices: Mix the spices together in a small bowl. Toss salmon with spices: Toss your salmon cubes in the spices and oil – I usually use my hands to mix it all together. Air fry the salmon: Place your salmon pieces in the air fryer (I just dump them right in) and spread them out a bit so they’re not laying all over each other. Air fry at 400 degrees for 8 minutes! You’re Done! Yum! At this point it should be textured and golden on the outside, and juicy and delicious on the inside. When you press each piece with a fork, they should easily flake / slip apart with a buttery, juicy texture inside.

296,30 Minute Brown Butter Goat Cheese Grilled Veggie Orzo,"First grill your veggies: preheat grill to 400 degrees. Place veggies in a large bowl, then drizzle them with olive oil, garlic powder and season with salt and pepper. GRILL BASKET OPTION: Grill veggies in a grill basket for 10-15 minutes or until veggies are tender and slightly charred; be sure to toss them halfway through cooking. Once the veggies are done cooking and have cooled a bit, you can chop them up to your liking. I like to chop the bell peppers, slice the onions and quarter the zucchini slices. FOIL OPTION FOR GRILLING: Place chopped veggies onto a large piece of foil, then add another large piece of foil on top. Seal the edges by folding a piece of foil together. Use a fork or knife to poke a hole at the top of the foil to allow some steam to escape. Place over direct heat on the preheated grill and grill for approximately 10-15 minutes or until veggies are just fork tender. While your veggies are grilling you can make your brown butter: add butter to a large saucepan or skillet and place over medium heat. The butter will begin to melt, crackle, and then eventually foam. Make sure you stir constantly during this process. After a couple of minutes, the butter will begin to brown and turn a nice golden amber color on the bottom of the saucepan, this usually happens right when it foams. Continue to whisk and remove from heat as soon as the butter begins to brown and give off a nutty aroma. Set aside to cool a bit (keeping butter in the pan but removing pan from heat) while you cook your pasta. Cook your pasta according to the directions on the package. Once pasta is done cooking, reserve 1/3 cup pasta water and set aside, then drain the pasta and add it to the skillet with the brown butter. Give it a nice stir to coat all the pasta with the brown butter, then immediately add in the goat cheese and reserved pasta water; stir until nice and creamy and the goat cheese has melted. Finally, add in all of the chopped grilled veggies, and generously season with salt and pepper to taste (I like a lot of black pepper!). Finally fold in the fresh julienned basil. Serve immediately. This pasta is excellent served warm or cold.","For the grilled veggies:; 1-2 tablespoons olive oil or avocado oil; 1 medium red bell pepper, halved or cut into ½” thick strips; 1 medium orange bell pepper, halved or cut into ½” thick strips; 1 sweet yellow onion, peeled and quartered (or cut into thick slices); 1 medium zucchini, cut into ½” thick rounds or strips; 1 teaspoon garlic powder; Freshly ground salt and pepper; For the pasta:; 8 oz orzo pasta (1 cup dried orzo); ⅓ cup reserved pasta water; ¼ cup salted butter; ½ cup goat cheese crumbles; Optional: 1 (15 ounce) can of chickpeas, rinsed and drained; 8-10 large basil leaves, julienned (about 1/3 cup packed basil); Freshly ground salt and pepper, to taste"

Add the pitted and halved cherries to the pan, then drizzle with olive oil, maple syrup and lemon zest; toss together then spread the cherries into a single layer. Bake for 25-30 minutes until cherries are nice and juicy. In a medium bowl mix together the ricotta, lemon juice, lemon zest and salt and pepper. Set aside. Meanwhile, preheat the grill to 400 degrees F or medium high heat. Grill each side of the crostini for approximately 2 minutes or until slightly golden brown, watching carefully so they crostini do not burn. Set aside onto a platter. Alternatively you can baked the crostini for 5 to 7 minutes at 400 degrees F in your oven. Once the crostini are cool enough to safely handle, top each one with a dollop of lemon ricotta, followed by a spoonful of roasted cherries and their juices. Finish off the crostini with a sprinkling of torn basil and a little extra lemon zest. Crostini are best served immediately.","1 french baguette, cut diagonally into 1/2 inch slices; For the roasted cherries:; 4 cups fresh dark sweet cherries, pitted and halved; 1 tablespoon olive oil; 1 tablespoon pure maple syrup; 1 teaspoon lemon zest; For the lemon ricotta:; 8 ounces whole milk ricotta; ½ lemon, juiced; Zest of 1 lemon; Freshly ground salt and pepper, to taste; To garnish:; Fresh basil ribbons"
300,Shepherd’s Pie Soup,"Place the potatoes in a pot, cover in water, bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the beef, onions and carrots in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, breaking the beef apart as it cooks, until the beef is cooked through, and drain off any excess grease. Add the garlic and tomato paste to the beef and cook until fragrant, about a minute. Add half of the broth, the remaining potatoes, the Worcestershire sauce, rosemary, thyme and bay leaves to the beef, bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, when the potatoes from step 1 are cooked, drain them and puree them, along with the sour cream and butter and the remaining broth before mixing into the soup. When the diced potatoes in the soup are tender, add the cheddar and let it melt into the soup, about 2 minutes. Add the peas and heat, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste and enjoy!","1 1/2 pounds potatoes, peeled and diced; 1 pound ground beef (or lamb); 1 cup onion, diced; 1 cup carrots, diced; 2 cloves garlic, chopped; 2 tablespoons tomato paste; 4 cups chicken broth (or beef broth); 1 1/2 pounds potatoes, peeled and diced; 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce; 1 teaspoon rosemary; 1 teaspoon thyme; 2 bay leaves; 2 tablespoons butter; 1/3 cup sour cream; 1 cup aged white cheddar cheese, shredded (optional); 1 cup frozen peas; salt and pepper to taste"
301,Steamed Artichokes,"Trim artichokes: Cut the bottom inch of thorny leaves off each artichoke. Remove any small, discolored leaves around the sides and closer to the stem; they’re not going to taste good. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the outer layer of the stem. Cut each artichoke in half through the stem, heart, and leaves. If you’d like, you can rub the cut parts of each artichoke with one lemon half to limit browning. Steam artichokes: Bring a couple inches of water to boil in a large pot with a lid and place a steamer basket [mine looks like this] in the bottom. Add artichokes — don’t worry about whether they’re standing or flopped over. Squeeze the juice of half a lemon over and nestle the empty lemon half in the middle, just for flavor. Cover with a lid and steam artichokes over moderate heat for 25 to 30 minutes, until the tip of a knife inserts easily into the thickest part where the leaves meet the stem. Use tongs to transfer artichokes to a cutting board, and use a spoon or paring knife to remove and discard the fuzzy choke. Your artichokes are now ready to eat, but if you’d like a fancy finish: For a sizzled finish: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add butter and garlic. Once hot, place cut sides of one artichoke in pan and cook until browned and crisp underneath, then transfer to serving platter. Repeat with remaining artichokes. Pour any butter left in pan and the garlic over your artichokes. Season with salt and pepper. To make my favorite artichoke dip: Place a spoonful of mayo (about 1 to 2 tablespoons, start with less) in a bowl and squeeze the juice of half a lemon over. Stir to combine and season well with freshly ground black pepper and a pinch or two of salt. If it needs more lemon — I like it very lemony — squeeze more in. If you’d prefer it creamier, add more mayo. Leftover artichoke halves keep in the fridge for a few days and can be rewarmed in the microwave or the oven, covered so they don’t dry out.","2 to 3 full-sized fresh artichokes; 1 to 2 lemons, halved; Salt, freshly ground black pepper; A big pat of butter (optional); A few garlic cloves, halved lengthwise (optional); Mayonnaise, for dipping sauce"
302,Pad Thai,"Cook noodles according to package instructions, just until tender.Rinse under cold water. Make sauce by combining sauce ingredients in a bowl. Set aside.  Stir Fry:: Heat 1½ tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp, chicken or tofu, garlic and bell pepper. The shrimp will cook quickly, about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until pink. If using chicken, cook until just cooked through, about 3-4 minutes, flipping only once. Push everything to the side of the pan. Add a little more oil and add the beaten eggs. Scramble the eggs, breaking them into small pieces with a spatula as they cook. Add noodles, sauce, bean sprouts and peanuts to the pan (reserving some peanuts for topping at the end). Toss everything to combine. Garnish the top with green onions, extra peanuts, cilantro and lime wedges. Serve immediately! Store leftovers in the fridge and enjoy within 2-3 days.","8 ounces flat rice noodles; 3 Tablespoons oil; 3 cloves garlic; 8 ounces uncooked shrimp, chicken, or extra-firm tofu; 2 eggs; 1 cup fresh bean sprouts; 1 red bell pepper; 3 green onions; 1/2 cup dry roasted peanuts; 2 limes; 1/2 cup Fresh cilantro; 3 Tablespoons fish sauce; 1 Tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce; 5 Tablespoons light brown sugar; 2 Tablespoons rice vinegar; 1 Tablespoon Sriracha hot sauce; 2 Tablespoons creamy peanut butter*"
303,How to Make Garlic Paste,"Peel garlic into individual cloves, chopping the ends to allow for a smooth garlic paste. In your food processor (or blender) add garlic cloves and oil. Blend until a smooth paste forms. Scrape down the sides as needed, eliminating any remaining chunks. Store and use as directed.",40-45 cloves Fresh garlic (approximately 4 heads of garlic); 1 tablespoon Extra virgin olive oil; 1 teaspoon Extra virgin olive oil
304,Sweet duck legs cooked with plums and star anise,"Place the duck legs in a sandwich bag with the soy sauce, five-spice, star anise, cinnamon stick and olive oil and let them marinate for a minimum of 2 hours. To really get the flavours going, you could keep this in your fridge to marinate for up to 2 days. Then get yourself a pan, casserole or high-sided roasting tray that snugly fits the duck legs. Place the chillies, plums and sugar in the bottom of the tray and then pour the marinade from the bag over the top. Mix it all up using your fingers, and place the duck legs on top. Place the tray in a preheated oven at 170°C/325°F/gas 3 for 2 to 2½ hours until the meat falls away from the bone. Remove the star anise and cinnamon stick, then taste the sauce to see if it needs to be seasoned with a little more soy sauce. It’s now down to you how you would like to serve it. You could have it as a starter with some of the little Chinese pancakes that you can buy, or served simply with rice or noodles and the chunky, jammy plum sauce that the duck has cooked in.","4 fat duck legs; 4 tablespoons soy sauce; 3 teaspoons five-spice; 1 handful star anise; ½ stick cinnamon; 1 tablespoon olive oil; 1-2 fresh red chillies , deseeded and sliced; 16 plums , halved and destoned; 2 tablespoons Demerara sugar"
305,Oven Baked Chicken Drumsticks,"Preheat the oven to 425ºF. Combine the smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, oregano, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Place the chicken drumsticks in a bowl and drizzle the cooking oil over top. Sprinkle the prepared seasoning over the drumsticks, then toss until they're evenly coated in oil and spices. Place the seasoned drumsticks on a baking sheet with enough space around each so they're not touching. You can line the baking sheet with foil or parchment for easier cleanup, if desired.  Transfer the chicken to the oven and bake for 40 minutes, or until they reach an internal temperature of 175ºF, flipping the drumsticks once half-way through. Serve hot.",1 tsp smoked paprika; 1/2 tsp garlic powder; 1/4 tsp onion powder; 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper; 1/4 tsp dried oregano; 1/2 tsp salt; 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper; 1.75 lbs. chicken drumsticks (6 pieces); 2 Tbsp cooking oil*
306,Summer Steak with Corn and Tomatoes,"Prep the steak: Pat steak dry and place on a plate or tray. If your grill or pan for cooking is smaller than the length of it, cut the steak into segments that will fit. Combine sugar, salt, paprika, and many grinds of black pepper in a small bowl then sprinkle half of it over the top of the steak; flip steak over and repeat on the second side. Transfer to the fridge and let chill for 30 minutes or up to a few hours, until you’re ready to grill. I do this uncovered to encourage the edges to dry out, which is just my preference; loosely covered works too. Make corn and tomato salad: Cook the corn your favorite way; I use the grill. Heat your grill to a high heat. Shuck the cobs, removing any stringy bits, and lightly oil the cobs. Place directly on the grill and cook until charred spots form, rotating the cobs as needed. This can take about 5 to 10 minutes, depending on how robust your grill is. Set the cobs aside to cool slightly while you make the dressing. Pour olive oil, cider vinegar, kosher salt, many grinds of black pepper, and minced garlic in a medium-large bowl and whisk to combine. When corn is cool enough to handle (with a towel, if needed), cut the kernels from the cob and add to the dressing in the bowl. Scatter tomatoes, jalapeño, scallions, and herbs on top of the corn in layers, but I don’t bother mixing it at this point. I like the corn to marinate and gently pickle in the dressing while I cook the steak. Do ahead: Corn salad can be made 1 hour in advance. If you’d like to make it even earlier, I’d leave the herbs off until right before serving so they don’t discolor.  Cook the steak: On a grill: Heat your grill to high for 10 minutes before using it. I like my (small, gas) grill as ripping hot as I can get it for a skirt steak, since it’s so thin and I want to get color on the outside before it overcooks in the center. Lightly oil the grill and the steak, cooking for 2 minutes on the first side, then flipping it and cooking it for 2 minutes on the second side for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board to rest for 5 to 7 minutes. On the stove: Heat your heaviest skillet, ideally cast-iron (this is my forever go-to) over high heat for several minutes, until the pan is smoking hot. Lightly coat it with a neutral oil and add the steak. If you had to cut yours into a few segments, you might only be able to cook two at a time. Cook for 2 minutes on the first side, then flip the steak and cook it for 2 minutes on the second side for a medium-rare steak. Transfer to a cutting board to rest for 5 to 7 minutes. Assemble and serve: Stir tomato-corn salad to mix the ingredients and taste, adjusting seasoning if needed. Once the steak has rested, cut it across the grain into 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick slices. Arrange steak fanned on a serving platter and drizzle any juices that have collected on the cutting board over it. Season lightly with additional salt and pepper. Spoon some tomato-corn salad over it, leaving the rest in a bowl on the side for adding more at the table. Eat right away.","Steak; 1 1/4- to 1 1/2-pound skirt steak; 2 tablespoons brown sugar; 1 tablespoon kosher salt; 1 teaspoon sweet or hot smoked paprika; Freshly ground black pepper; Salad; 2 ears fresh corn; 2 tablespoons olive oil; 4 tablespoons apple cider vinegar; 1 teaspoon kosher salt; Freshly ground black pepper; 1 clove garlic, minced; 4 scallions, thinly sliced (white and green); 2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved or quartered; 1 jalapeño, seeds removed, finely chopped; 1 cup finely-chopped fresh herbs such as parsley, mint, basil, chives, or a mix thereof"
307,Braised greens,"Half fill a large pot with salted water, bring to the boil and add your silverbeet and chicory. Cook for 2 or 3 minutes until the greens are tender, or al dente, then drain in a colander. To your empty pan add 4 large lugs of olive oil and the garlic. Fry the garlic until lightly coloured, then throw in your cooked chicory and silverbeet. Season and stir around to coat in all the lovely flavoured oil. After 1 minute, remove from the heat, add the rocket and squeeze in the lemon juice. Stir once more, check the seasoning again, and serve immediately. Great with grilled meats or scallops, or even served cold on an antipasti plate.","2 large handfuls of silverbeet; 2 large handfuls of chicory; olive oil; 2 large cloves of garlic , peeled and finely sliced; sea salt; freshly ground black pepper; 2 large handfuls of rocket; ½ lemon"
308,Homemade Mac and Cheese,"Cook the macaroni according to the package directions (boil for 7-8 minutes, or until tender). Drain the macaroni in a colander.  Place the butter, flour, and onion powder in a medium pot. Whisk and heat over medium until the butter is melted and the mixture begins to bubble. Once bubbling, continue to whisk and cook for one minute. After cooking the butter and flour roux, whisk in the milk. Continue to cook and whisk over medium heat until the milk begins to gently simmer, at which point it will thicken to the consistency of heavy cream or gravy. Turn the burner off. Season the white sauce with the salt and hot sauce. Begin to add the shredded cheddar, one handful at a time, whisking it in until completely melted before adding more. Continue until all of the cheese has been melted into the sauce. If the sauce becomes too cold to melt the cheese, place it back over low heat only briefly to continue melting the cheese. Overheating the sauce can cause it to break and become grainy. Add the cooked and drained pasta to the pot with the cheese sauce and stir to combine. Serve the mac and cheese hot and enjoy!","8 oz. macaroni; 3 Tbsp butter; 3 Tbsp all-purpose flour; 1/2 tsp onion powder; 2 cups whole milk; 1/2 tsp hot sauce*; 1/2 tsp salt; 8 oz. block sharp cheddar, shredded"
309,Mediterranean Tomato & Feta Dip,"Combine the quartered tomatoes and sliced olives on a large serving platter or in a medium-sized serving bowl. Set aside. In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, vinegar and pepper. Whisk until blended. Drizzle all of the mixture over the tomatoes and olives, and toss to combine. Sprinkle the crumbled feta and chopped basil over the tomatoes. Gently toss a few times to combine. Serve immediately, with accompaniments of your choice. This dip is best when fresh, since the tomatoes continue to release their juices over time, but leftovers (covered and chilled) are still good for a day or two.","2 pints (4 cups) cherry tomatoes, quartered  (I love a mix of red and yellow); ½ cup pitted Kalamata olives, thinly sliced; 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil; 2 tablespoons lemon juice; 2 tablespoons oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, rinsed and chopped; 2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced; 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar; 10 twists of freshly ground black pepper;

310,Raw vegan spag bol,"The night before, put the sundried tomatoes and dates in a non-reactive bowl, pour over 200ml of water. In a separate bowl and cover the walnuts with water and place both bowls in the fridge to soak overnight. For the ‘spaghetti’, use a spiraliser to cut the courgettes into long curly strands or use a julienne peeler to slice into thin strips. Set aside. To make ‘parmesan’, blitz the cauliflower florets in a food processor until you have a grainy consistency. Place it on kitchen towel to soak up excess moisture while you prepare the rest of the dish. Place the garlic, rosemary and chilli in a food processor and blitz until finely chopped. Add the carrot, celery, red pepper and onion and blitz again until chunky. Drain and rinse the walnuts and add to the other ingredients in the processor with the beetroot, plum tomatoes, 150g of the cherry tomatoes, the lemon zest and juice, dates and sundried tomatoes (with their soaking liquid), parsley and half of the basil leaves. Quarter the remaining cherry tomatoes and set aside to garnish. Process the mixture until it forms a thick sauce and the walnut pieces resemble a minced texture. Depending how juicy your tomatoes are, you might need to thin it with a little extra water. Season to taste. To serve, divide the courgette ‘spaghetti’ between plates, pour over the sauce, sprinkle with the quartered tomatoes and cauliflower ‘parmesan’, then top with the remaining basil.",25 g sun-dried tomatoes; 2 dates; 50 g walnuts; 4 courgettes; 4-5 cauliflower florets; ½ a red onion; 1 small clove of garlic; 1 sprig of fresh rosemary; ½ a small red chilli; ½ a carrot; ½ a stick of celery; ¼ of a red pepper; ½ a beetroot; 225 g cherry tomatoes; ½ lemon; ½ a bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley; ½ a bunch of fresh basil
311,Best Stuffed Shells,"Preheat the oven to 375 with racks in the middle and upper third of the oven. Bring a large Dutch oven or stockpot of water to boil over high heat. Generously salt the water (use at least 2 teaspoons). If you’re not using frozen greens, fill a large bowl with ice water for blanching.  If you’re using fresh greens, add them to the boiling water and cook just until wilted, about 20 to 40 seconds. Using tongs (leave the water in the pot), transfer the greens to the ice bath and let them cool down. Drain off the water and squeeze as much excess water from the greens as possible. Set aside. (If you’re using frozen greens, place them in a colander and run cool water over them until they’ve full defrosted. Squeeze out as much excess water as possible, and set aside.) Bring the water in the pot back to a boil. Gently add the pasta shells in handfuls so they don’t break on the way in. Cook until pliable but just shy of al dente, about 10 minutes, stirring often so they don’t stick to the pot. Drain off the water, return the noodles to the pot, and gently stir in the olive oil to prevent the noodles from sticking. Set aside. Turn on your food processor and drop the garlic through the feeding tube. Once the garlic is chopped and stuck to the sides of the bowl, stop the machine and scrape down the sides. For good measure, squeeze off any remaining water in the greens, then add them to the bowl. Process until the greens are chopped into small pieces. Add the ricotta and process until well blended. Add half of the mozzarella, reserving the rest for topping. Add all of the Parmesan and chives, about 10 twists of black pepper, the red pepper flakes and salt. Blend well. Taste, and add additional salt, pepper or red pepper flakes if desired. Finally, add the egg and process until blended. Set aside. If you have an extra-large baking dish (larger than 9×13 inches), spread 1 cup of the marinara sauce across the bottom. Otherwise, divide 1 cup marinara between a large (9×13 inches) and medium-sized baker (say, an 8-inch square). You might need to add another splash of sauce to evenly coat the bottom of the pans. Stuff each intact shell with a heaping spoonful (about 1 ½ to 2 tablespoons) of the green mixture. Place each stuffed shell in the baker in rows. (You might have a few leftover or broken shells; save them for another use.) Spoon the remaining marinara sauce over the tops of the shells. Top the shells with the remaining mozzarella. Cover the baker(s) tightly with foil and bake on the middle rack for 30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and place the bakers on the upper rack. Bake for 5 to 10 more minutes, until the mozzarella is fully melted and turning just slightly golden (you can bake longer for a more golden effect, but the greens will become less vibrant). Garnish the shells with a light dusting of grated Parmesan and some small or torn fresh basil leaves. Leftover shells will keep well in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, or freeze them for several months.","1 pound (16 ounces) fresh baby spinach or baby kale, or frozen spinach or kale, or 1 ½ pounds Tuscan kale or spinach bunches, washed and stems removed; 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil; 12 ounces jumbo shells; 4 cloves garlic, peeled and cut into several segments ; 15 ounces (or 1 pound) ricotta cheese or cottage cheese; 8 ounces (2 cups) grated part-skim mozzarella, divided; ½ cup (2 ounces) grated Parmesan, plus extra for garnish ; ¼ cup (⅔-ounce) chives or green onions (mostly green parts), cut into ¼-long pieces ; Freshly ground pepper, to taste; ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes, to taste (omit if sensitive to spice); ¾ teaspoon fine sea salt, to taste; 1 large egg, lightly beaten with a fork; 3 cups (24 ounces) marinara sauce, homemade* or store-bought (I used Rao’s); Fresh basil for garnish, optional"
312,Easy Sesame Chicken,"First, prepare the sauce. In a small bowl stir together the soy sauce, water, sesame oil, brown sugar, rice vinegar, fresh ginger, minced garlic, cornstarch, and sesame seeds. (Grate the ginger with a small-holed cheese grater). Set the sauce aside. In a large bowl, whisk together the egg, 2 Tbsp cornstarch, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Trim any excess fat from the chicken thighs, then cut them into small 1 inch pieces. Toss the chicken in the egg and cornstarch mixture. Add the cooking oil to a large skillet and heat it over medium flame. Wait until the skillet is very hot, then swirl the skillet to make sure the oil coats the entire surface. Add the batter coated chicken and spread it out into a single layer over the surface of the skillet.  Allow the chicken pieces to cook, undisturbed, until golden brown on the bottom. Then, carefully flip the chicken, breaking up the pieces into smaller clumps as you flip. Continue to cook the chicken until golden brown on the other side. Stir the chicken as little as possible to avoid breaking the egg coating from the surface of the chicken. Once the chicken is cooked through and golden brown on all sides, pour the sauce over top. Toss the chicken to coat in the sauce. As the sauce comes up to a simmer, it will begin to thicken. Continue to gently stir the chicken in the sauce until it has thickened, then turn off the heat. Serve the chicken over a bed of rice and sprinkle the sliced green onions over top.","1 large egg; 2 Tbsp cornstarch; 1 pinch each salt and  pepper; 1 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs; 2 Tbsp cooking oil; 1/4 cup soy sauce; 2 Tbsp water; 1 Tbsp toasted sesame oil; 3 Tbsp brown sugar; 1  Tbsp rice vinegar; 1 tsp grated fresh ginger; 2 cloves garlic, minced; 1 Tbsp sesame seeds; 1/2 Tbsp cornstarch; 4 cups cooked jasmine rice; 2 whole green onions"

If needed, break the fettuccine in half to make sure it lays flat in the skillet and is submerged in broth. Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to high, and bring the broth to a boil. As soon as it reaches a boil, give the pasta a good stir, replace the lid, and turn the heat down to low or the lowest setting that maintains a simmer. Let the pasta simmer in the broth for 7-10 minutes, or until most of the broth is absorbed and the pasta is tender, stirring every couple of minutes and always replacing the lid. Keeping the heat on low, cut the cream cheese into chunks and stir it into the pasta. Once the cream cheese has melted, add the milk and stir until a smooth sauce forms. Finally, add the grated Parmesan over top and stir until it has melted into the sauce.

Continue boiling, reducing heat if necessary to prevent overflow, for about 20 minutes, or until the chickpeas look bloated, their skins are falling off, and they’re quite soft. In a fine-mesh strainer, drain the chickpeas and run cool water over them for about 30 seconds. Set aside (no need to peel the chickpeas for this recipe!). Meanwhile, in a food processor or high-powered blender, combine the lemon juice, garlic and salt. Process until the garlic is very finely chopped, then let the mixture rest so the garlic flavor can mellow, ideally 10 minutes or longer. Add the tahini to the food processor and blend until the mixture is thick and creamy, stopping to scrape down any tahini stuck to the sides and bottom of the processor as necessary. While running the food processor, drizzle in 2 tablespoons ice water. Scrape down the food processor, and blend until the mixture is ultra smooth, pale and creamy.

While blending, drizzle in the olive oil. Blend until the mixture is super smooth, scraping down the sides of the processor as necessary, about 2 minutes. Add more ice water by the tablespoon if necessary to achieve a super creamy texture.

After the ribs have been in the smoker for 3 hours, take them out and wrap each rack with aluminum foil. Pour a 1/4 cup of beer, pop or apple juice with each rack of ribs. Fold over the foil and pinch all the edges to ensure that it is sealed well to allow steaming. If your smoker can function as an oven (like Bradley smokers) place the ribs wrapped in foil back in the smoker for another 2 hours. It is also possible to use an oven for this stage. Have it set for 225F and bake them for 2 hours. After these 2 hours, remove the ribs carefully from the foil. Generously coat the ribs in your favourite BBQ sauce. Put them back in the smoker set for 225F for 1 final hour.

361,Gluten-Free Almond Cake with Berries on Top,"Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Generously grease a 9″ springform pan* and dust it with almond meal to prevent sticking. To make the cake: In a large bowl, combine 2 cups of the almond meal, the baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Whisk to blend. Crack the eggs into a medium bowl and beat with a whisk until the yolks and egg whites have blended together. Add the maple syrup, olive oil, and lemon zest and whisk to blend. Pour the wet ingredients into the almond meal mixture and stir until there are just a few clumps remaining. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan (it will be runny; don’t worry). Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the cake is golden brown and the center is firm to the touch. Meanwhile, to make the glaze: In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon maple syrup until blended. (If you’re using honey instead and having a hard time blending it into the lemon juice, place the bowl on top of your stove to warm it up while the cake bakes, or warm it briefly in the microwave until you can whisk them together.) Once the cake is out of the oven, place the cake, pan and all, on a cooling rack. While the cake is warm, use a pastry brush to brush the glaze over the top of the cake. It should soak right in. Let the cake cool for at least 30 minutes. Carefully remove the outer piece from your springform pan. Spread yogurt evenly on top, then place strawberries and blueberries on top. Sprinkle with some additional lemon zest, then slice the cake with a sharp knife and serve!

362,Perfect Blueberry Muffins,"Heat oven to 375°F. Line a muffin tin with 9 paper liners or spray each cup with a nonstick spray. Melt butter in the bottom of a large bowl and whisk in sugar, zest, yogurt and egg until smooth. Whisk in baking powder, baking soda and salt until fully combined, then lightly fold in flour and berries. Batter will be very thick, like a cookie dough. Divide between prepared muffin cups and sprinkle each with 1 teaspoon turbinado sugar, which will seem over-the-top but I promise, will be the perfect crunchy lid at the end. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until tops are golden and a tester inserted into the center of muffins comes out clean (you know, except for blueberry goo). Let cool in pan for 10 minutes then the rest of the way on a rack.  These, like most muffins, are best on the first day, we’ve found through extensive “research” that if you run them split open under a broiler on day two with a pat of salted butter, it’s so good that you’re going to forever hope for more blueberry muffin leftovers. Extended notes! This began with an adaptation of an old Cook’s Illustrated blueberry muffin but with so many changes, it no longer resembles the original. I use yogurt instead of buttermilk, less sugar, I’ve adapted it to make it one-bowl and then in August 2016 it got the biggest overhaul yet after a month of blueberry muffin studies. From Stella Parks at Serious Eats, I came to agree that a full teaspoon of coarse sugar on top of each muffin sounds crazy but actually makes a delightfully crunchy lid. If the muffin underneath it isn’t too sweet, it doesn’t put it over the top at all — it’s just right. I also found her combination of coriander (I know!) and nutmeg crazy good and worth trying if you’re curious, even if I’m still defaulting to my lemon zest only here. From Blythe Danner, I realized you could put an inordinate amount of berries in each muffin and still have a very good muffin. I ended up doubling the berries in my go-to in the last batch and regret not-a-thing. (Should you be hesitant, just an increase from 3/4 cups to 1 1/4 is excellent but not over-the-top improvement.) I found it made 9 taller and more gorgeous muffins than it did of the 10 to 11 in the original recipe; just double it for a crowd.

Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat down to medium-low, and let the eggs simmer in the sauce for 7-10 minutes, or until they reach your desired doneness (less time for runny yolks, more time for solid yolks).

In a medium mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, melted butter, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and salt. Stir until the dough is uniformly blended and smooth. Pour the sugar into a small bowl and set it aside. Use a small cookie scoop (size 70 portioner) or scoop 2 teaspoons of the dough with measuring spoons. Gently roll the dough into a ball between your palms. Drop the ball into the bowl of sugar and roll it around until lightly coated all around. Gently roll it into a ball once more and place it on the cookie sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough, keeping the balls about 2 inches apart. To make indentions for the jam, use the rounded back of a teaspoon or your thumb to gently press an indentation in the center of each cookie dough ball. If the dough cracks around the edges, take the time to gently smooth it back together. Fill each indentation with a level ½ teaspoon of jam (no more!). If the jam is too firm to work with, gently warm it in the microwave for a few seconds, just until it’s easy to stir.

Snap each bean in half, or leave the beans whole for a more dramatic presentation.  Place one inch of water in a pot or deep skillet. Place the steam basket inside the pot. The water should not be so deep that it comes up through the holes in the steam basket. Fill the steam basket with the washed green beans. Place a lid on the pot or skillet, turn the heat onto high, and allow the water to come to a boil (about 3 minutes). Allow the green beans to steam for about 5 minutes from the time the water begins to boil, or until they have reached your desired level of tenderness. Aim for green beans that are vibrant in color and tender but not mushy. You can test the tenderness of the green beans with a fork. Once cooked to your liking, remove the pot from the heat. Remove the steam basket with the green beans and discard the water from the bottom of the pot. Place the beans back in the pot without the steam basket and add some butter.

Scatter garlic, onion, pepper flakes, salt, and zucchini on top and drizzle olive oil over. No need to stir.  Bring the ingredients to a simmer and cover with a lid to cook for 45 minutes total. However, at the 15-minute mark, remove the lid (but still, no need to stir yet). At the 30-minute mark, stir ingredients to evenly combine. If all of the liquid is gone from the pan or the chickpeas are sticking to the bottom, add remaining 1/2 cup broth.  Remove pan from heat and stir in pesto in dollops. Make divots for the burrata, using your fingers to tear it into chunks before nudging them into the pan. Finish with some parmesan and extra pepper flakes.

If you’re planning ahead, I’d wait to add the finishes (burrata and parmesan) until the chickpeas have reheated. Notes: To keep this gluten-free, you’ll need to use a gluten-free bread for serving.  If the layering of onion, garlic, and vegetables sounds a bit like my One-Pan Farro with Tomatoes, it is not accidental. This dish started as a zucchini riff on it, which came out absolutely deliciously but didn’t feel “new” enough to warrant a new recipe on the site. Plus, we loved the chickpea version even more.

463,"Vegan mushroom, chestnut & cranberry tart","Preheat the oven and a large baking tray to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Start by making the pastry. Sift the flour and xanthan gum into a food processor, add the margarine, vegetable shortening and a pinch of sea salt, and pulse until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. If you don’t have a food processor, place the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and cut together with the flat of a knife. Add 2 tablespoons of cold water, pulsing as you go (or stirring with a flat-bladed knife, if making the pastry by hand), until the mixture begins to pull together to form a dough. Tip the pastry into a large bowl (or keep in the same bowl, if making it by hand) and, using your fingertips, pull together into a ball. Knead lightly for about 2 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Shape the pastry into a ball and place between 2 large sheets of clingfilm, then roll it out into a circle slightly larger than the tart tin and no thinner than 3mm. Peel off the uppermost sheet of clingfilm and carefully flip the pastry into a deep 23cm tart tin. Peel away the remaining clingfilm and gently press the pastry into the sides of the tin, filling in any cracks with pastry and patting it flat with your fingertips. Trim the edges and set aside. Next, prepare the potatoes. Peel and cut in half, quartering any large ones. Place in a pan of salted water and bring to the boil. The second the water begins to boil, time the potatoes, allowing them to cook for 4 minutes before removing from the heat and draining. Shake the potatoes in the colander a little to chuff up the edges – this helps them crisp up. Pour 8 tablespoons of the groundnut oil into a large roasting tin, tip in the potatoes and 1 heaped teaspoon of sea salt and firmly shake to coat evenly. Set aside while you make the filling for the tart. Finely chop the onion, crush the garlic, then finely grate the carrots. Trim the stalks from the chestnut mushrooms and slice into rounds. Halve 240g of the chestnuts (the rest will be used for the topping). Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a heavy-based frying pan until hot, add the onions and cook gently over a low heat until softened. Add the carrots, garlic, thyme and mushrooms, and fry gently until softened and all of the liquid from the mushrooms has been absorbed – around 10 minutes. Stir in the cream cheese and halved chestnuts and mix together gently until the cheese has softened and formed a creamy mixture. Season to taste, spoon the filling into the pastry case then level the top. Place the tart on the baking tray on the top shelf of the oven and the potatoes on the bottom shelf. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until the pastry is crisp. Remove the tart from the oven, cover loosely in foil to retain its heat and set aside. Move the potatoes to the top shelf of the oven and increase the temperature to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. Continue roasting the potatoes for a further 25 to 30 minutes until golden and crisp. For the gravy, heat the walnut oil and redcurrant jelly in a small saucepan, stirring until melted and smooth. Add the hot stock, bring to a simmer and stir in the cornflour. Simmer gently and stir continuously until you have the desired consistency. Set aside. Finally, tear the wild mushrooms into pieces, roughly chop the remaining chestnuts and finely chop the parsley.

Return the meat to the slow cooker and stir to combine with the soup. The noodles should be tender after about 8-10 minutes of being in the soup (this may take a few minutes longer if the slow cooker was previously set to low). Once the chicken has been returned to the soup and the noodles are tender, begin seasoning the soup with salt. The true flavor of the soup will not be pronounced until it is properly salted. Start with 1 tsp salt, adding more until the soup is bold and flavorful. I use about 1 Tbsp (3 tsp).

471,One Pot Chicken and Rice,"Combine the paprika, oregano, thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Coat both sides of the chicken thighs in the seasoning mix. Add 1 Tbsp cooking oil to a deep skillet and heat over medium. Once hot, swirl to coat the surface of the skillet, then add the chicken thighs. Cook the thighs for a few minutes on each side, or until well browned. The chicken does not need to be cooked through at this point. Remove the browned chicken to a clean plate. Reduce the heat to medium-low, add an additional 1 Tbsp cooking oil to the skillet, then add the diced onion. Sauté the onion for about 5 minutes, or until softened. Allow the moisture from the onion to dissolve the browned bits from the skillet as you stir. Add the uncooked rice to the skillet and continue to sauté for 1-2 minutes more to toast the rice.  Add the vegetable broth to the skillet and briefly stir to dissolve any remaining brown bits from the bottom of the skillet. Return the chicken to the skillet, setting it on top of the rice.

472,Vibrant Lime Bars,"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line an 8x8 inch square pan (DO NOT USE 9x9 inch as it will be too big). NOTE: It’s important to use an 8x8 inch as a 9x9 inch pan may be too big. In a medium pot, add the sugar and lime zest and use clean fingers to rub the mixture together for about 30 seconds so the lime releases into the sugar and infuses it with flavor. Next, add the lime juice, eggs, and flour and whisk together until the mixture is well combined and no streaks of egg remain. Do not add in the butter or food dye yet. Set the pot aside. In a medium bowl, add the almond flour, coconut oil, maple syrup, vanilla extract and salt. Mix together with a fork until it forms a nice thick crumb texture. Add to the pan and use your fingers to evenly press down into the pan. Bake for 8-9 minutes until the crust is slightly golden brown on the edges. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for 5 minutes. Keep heat in the oven. While the crust cooks, place the pot over medium-low heat and whisk constantly until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 6 to 8 minutes. Once the mixture has thickened, remove from heat. Place a sieve (fine mesh strainer) over a medium bowl. Pour mixture into the sieve and use a spoon to work and mash down the filling through the stainer. In the bowl with the warm lime filling, stir in the butter until melted and a few drops of green food dye to achieve a vibrant green color, if desired. Immediately pour the mixture over the warm crust and tilt the pan or spread with a spatula to evenly distribute the lime filling. Place the pan back in the oven and bake for another 8 to 11 minutes until the filling is set and barely jiggly when the pan is gently shaken. Allow bars to cool at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours, then transfer to the fridge and chill for at least 6 hours or up to 2 days. Dust with powdered sugar and cut into 16 bars using a clean, sharp, wet knife. Clean and wet the knife after each cut. Annoying, but it helps to get the perfect cut! Add a little extra lime zest on top if you want a little extra zing. To store: Place leftover bars in an airtight container and place in the fridge for up to 4 days. If you are stacking the bars, add a sheet of parchment paper in between the layers to prevent sticking. You will likely need to add additional powdered sugar on top of the bars before serving as it may dissolve into the bars in the fridge.","For the lime base:; 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar; 2 tablespoons lime zest; ½ cup (100g) fresh squeezed lime juice (you’ll need 6 to 10 limes, depending on how big the limes are); 4 large eggs; ¼ cup (30g) all-purpose flour*; 2 tablespoons salted butter (or vegan butter), at room temperature; 1 to 4 drops of artificial dye-free green food coloring (optional, to get a bright green color); For the shortbread base:; 1 ½ cups (168g) fine blanched almond flour; 3 tablespoons melted coconut oil (or sub melted vegan butter or regular butter); 2 tablespoons pure maple syrup; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract; ¼ teaspoon salt; For serving:; Powdered sugar, for dusting; Additional lime zest, optional"
473,Easy Baked Ziti,"Brown the sausage in a large skillet or pot over medium heat, until it's brown and crispy on the edges (pork sausage contains a lot of fat, so I didn't add any extra to the skillet). While the sausage is browning, finely dice the onion. Add the onion to the skillet once the sausage has browned, and continue to sauté over medium heat until the onion is soft and translucent. Add the tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning, and  ½  cup water to the skillet with the sausage and stir to combine. Place a lid on the skillet and allow it to come up to a simmer. Once simmering, turn the heat down and allow it to continue to simmer while you cook the ziti. Stir the sauce occasionally as it simmers. After getting the sauce started, begin the ziti. Bring a large pot of water with ½ Tbsp salt to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, add the ziti, and let it continue to boil until the ziti is tender (about 7-8 minutes). Drain the ziti in a colander. Shake the colander a bit to shake excess water out of the pasta. While the pasta and sauce are cooking, prepare the cheese filling. Add the ricotta, Italian cheese blend, and some freshly cracked black pepper (about 10 cranks of a pepper mill) to a bowl and stir to combine. Begin to preheat the oven to 350ºF. After draining the ziti, return it to the pot and add 1 cup of the red sauce. Stir to coat the cooked pasta in sauce. Pour half of the ziti to a 9×13"" baking dish. Add half of the ricotta mixture on top of the ziti in small dollops. Finally, spoon half of the red sauce and sausage over the pasta and ricotta. It's okay if the ingredients don't cover in a solid layer. Repeat these layers with the second half of the pasta, ricotta mixture, and sauce. Finally, top with 2 cups shredded mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with foil, making sure it's slightly tented so that it doesn't touch or stick to the melted cheese. Transfer the covered casserole to the oven and bake for 20 minutes.  After baking for 20 minutes, remove the foil, and turn the oven on to broil (keep the casserole on the middle rack, about 10-12 inches from the broiler). Broil for 5 minutes, or just until the cheese is slightly browned. Keep a close eye on the baked ziti as it broils, because broilers can vary in intensity. Top with chopped parsley, if desired, then serve.","1 lb. Italian sausage (sweet, mild, or hot); 1 yellow onion; 3 oz. tomato paste; 1 28oz. can crushed tomatoes; 1 Tbsp Italian seasoning blend; 1/2 cup water; 1 lb. ziti; 1/2 Tbsp salt (for pasta water); 15 oz. ricotta; 1 cup Italian cheese blend*; 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper; 2  cups  shredded mozzarella; 1 handful chopped parsley (optional, for garnish)"
474,Sour Cream and Onion Potato Salad,"Place 2 lb. baby Yukon Gold potatoes in a large pot, cover with 3 qt. water, then 1 cup kosher salt, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. (Yes, this is a lot of salt, but it’s the right amount for the job. Potatoes are big and dense—so it takes highly concentrated water to ensure they're seasoned through and through, Plus, think about how much of that gets left behind in the water you pour out!) Once water comes to a boil, reduce heat, adjusting as needed to maintain a simmer, and cook potatoes until fork-tender, 15–20 minutes. Meanwhile, make your dressing. Combine ¾ cup sour cream, ¼ cup mayonnaise, 1 Tbsp. onion powder, 2 tsp. Dijon mustard, and 1 tsp. black pepper in a large bowl. Finely grate 1 garlic clove into dressing and stir to combine. Thinly slice 1 bunch chives. Transfer half of chives to dressing; set remaining aside for serving. Slice ¼ small red onion as thinly as possible through root end. (This might not be the way you usually cut an onion, but we're going for shallow arcs rather than chunky quarter-moons.) Transfer to a fine-mesh sieve and rinse for several seconds (this eliminates some of that astringent raw onion flavor). Pat dry with paper towels. Add half of onion to bowl with dressing; reserve remaining onion for serving. When potatoes are tender, scoop out ½ cup potato cooking liquid—we're going to use this later to thicken the sauce, warm up the cold dairy, and flavor the potatoes. Drain potatoes in a colander and let cool 10 minutes or until cool enough to handle. Crush each potato slightly with your hands (it's easiest to do this if you transfer them to a baking sheet or big plate first) and add to bowl with dressing. Toss potatoes with dressing and ¼ cup potato cooking liquid. You want to do this while the potatoes are still warm so that they'll better absorb all of the seasoning. Don't worry if the dressing looks a little loose and watery at the beginning—it will all get absorbed and be nice and creamy. Taste and add more salt or, if your dressing looks too thick, a splash of potato cooking liquid. Top potatoes with reserved chives and onion. Crumble ½ cup sour cream and onion potato chips over—in big pieces if you really just want to be eating a bag of chips or in small pieces if you'd like more of a bread crumb effect.","2 lb. baby Yukon Gold potatoes; 1 cup kosher salt, plus more; ¾ cup sour cream; ¼ cup mayonnaise; 1 Tbsp. onion powder; 2 tsp. Dijon mustard; 1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper; 1 garlic clove; 1 bunch chives; ¼ small red onion; ½ cup sour cream and onion potato chips"

477,Classic Mojito,"In a sturdy, heavy-bottomed, tall cocktail glass, add the sugar and 3 sprigs of the mint (we’ll reserve the last sprig for garnish).  Muddle the mint with the sugar about 5 to 10 times, until the mint is very fragrant (not so much that the mint completely falls apart).  Pour in the rum and the lime juice, and gently stir a few times to help dissolve the sugar. Fill the glass with ice.  Fill the glass with club soda nearly to the top. Gently stir in a circular motion to combine, then use your spoon to drag some of the muddled mint higher up into the glass.  Taste, and stir in more sugar if desired. Add a drop or two of bitters, if desired.  To garnish, place the lime round in the glass. Gently clap the remaining sprig of mint between your palms (this releases some of the oils) and tuck it into your glass, leaving the top exposed. Serve cold, with a wide straw. ","1 ½ teaspoons sugar, to taste; 4 leafy sprigs of fresh mint, each about 5 to 6 inches long; 2 ounces white rum; ¾ ounce lime juice ; Ice; Club soda or sparkling water (I like Topo Chico); Entirely optional: 1 to 2 drops of Angostura bitters; 1 lime round, for garnish"

You may need to scrape down the sides a few times with a spatula, then process again. Add in the oats, coconut, protein powder and freeze dried strawberries and process again. The mixture may seem crumbly at first, but see if you can squeeze a little bit between your fingers and if it sticks, you should be able to form it into balls. Use your hands to roll 1 tablespoon balls of dough. If you choose to roll these in a topping, you can roll them in crushed or blended/finely processed freeze dried strawberries. Another option is to roll them into toasted coconut or even drizzle with melted dark chocolate for a sweet treat – up to you.

483,Blistered Peas-in-the-Pod with Lemon and Salt,"Wash and pat dry the fresh peas in their pods. Toss in a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil. Heat your grill to a medium-high temperature. Use tongs to arrange the pea pods across grill grates so they don’t fall in. Grill for about 5 minutes on the first side, until blistered and dark in spots underneath. Flip pea pods over and repeat on second side, another 5 minutes, adding another minute or two if needed. [Note: My grill is small and fairly weak. This might take less time on a more robust grill. Look for blistering, not a measured amount of time.] Transfer grilled peas to a serving plate. Season with salt, pepper, and lemon zest; nestle lemon wedges on the plate for those who want fresh juice on theirs. There are two ways to serve these:Edamame-style: Serve in the closed pods, just like this, to be eaten “edamame-style” — i.e. holding the pod in your hand and popping the peas into your mouth, discarding the pod.Raft-style: Alternatively, you can peel open the pods, exposing the row of peas inside.

Add the sausage and cooking oil to a deep skillet or Dutch oven and sauté over medium heat until the sausage is well browned. Don't worry if the sausage begins to brown on the bottom of the skillet.

Once the sausage is browned, add the bell pepper to the skillet and continue to sauté for about one more minute. Add the spices (smoked paprika, oregano, thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, and black pepper) to the skillet with the sausage and bell pepper and continue to sauté for one minute more to toast the spices.

495,Zucchini Fritters,"Wash the zucchini well, trim off the stem, then using the large holes on a box grater, grate the zucchini. You should end up with about 4 cups of grated zucchini. Place the grated zucchini in a fine mesh cheesecloth or a strainer over a bowl. Sprinkle ½ tsp of salt over the zucchini. Give the zucchini a quick mix and let it sit for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, using the cheesecloth or clean hands, squeeze out as much liquid as you can into the bowl or over the sink. Add the grated zucchini to a large bowl along with the finely diced onion, garlic, flour, parmesan cheese, egg, ½ tsp salt, and ½ tsp freshly cracked black pepper. Mix all of the ingredients together until well combined. In a large non-stick skillet, heat the cooking oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add several spoonfuls of the zucchini mixture to the hot skillet to form small pancake-sized patties. Gently flatten the tops of each fritter with the back of a spoon or a spatula and cook each fritter until it is golden brown on both sides – about 3 minutes per side. Cook the fritters in 2 batches to keep from crowding the pan. Remove the fritters from the pan and drain on a wire rack or paper towel lined plate.

496,Summer Steak with Corn and Tomatoes,"Prep the steak: Pat steak dry and place on a plate or tray. If your grill or pan for cooking is smaller than the length of it, cut the steak into segments that will fit. Combine sugar, salt, paprika, and many grinds of black pepper in a small bowl then sprinkle half of it over the top of the steak; flip steak over and repeat on the second side. Transfer to the fridge and let chill for 30 minutes or up to a few hours, until you’re ready to grill. I do this uncovered to encourage the edges to dry out, which is just my preference; loosely covered works too. Make corn and tomato salad: Cook the corn your favorite way; I use the grill. Heat your grill to a high heat. Shuck the cobs, removing any stringy bits, and lightly oil the cobs. Place directly on the grill and cook until charred spots form, rotating the cobs as needed. This can take about 5 to 10 minutes, depending on how robust your grill is. Set the cobs aside to cool slightly while you make the dressing. Pour olive oil, cider vinegar, kosher salt, many grinds of black pepper, and minced garlic in a medium-large bowl and whisk to combine. When corn is cool enough to handle (with a towel, if needed), cut the kernels from the cob and add to the dressing in the bowl. Scatter tomatoes, jalapeño, scallions, and herbs on top of the corn in layers, but I don’t bother mixing it at this point. I like the corn to marinate and gently pickle in the dressing while I cook the steak. Do ahead: Corn salad can be made 1 hour in advance. If you’d like to make it even earlier, I’d leave the herbs off until right before serving so they don’t discolor.  Cook the steak: On a grill: Heat your grill to high for 10 minutes before using it. I like my (small, gas) grill as ripping hot as I can get it for a skirt steak, since it’s so thin and I want to get color on the outside before it overcooks in the center. Lightly oil the grill and the steak, cooking for 2 minutes on the first side, then flipping it and cooking it for 2 minutes on the second side for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board to rest for 5 to 7 minutes. On the stove: Heat your heaviest skillet, ideally cast-iron (this is my forever go-to) over high heat for several minutes, until the pan is smoking hot. Lightly coat it with a neutral oil and add the steak. If you had to cut yours into a few segments, you might only be able to cook two at a time. Cook for 2 minutes on the first side, then flip the steak and cook it for 2 minutes on the second side for a medium-rare steak. Transfer to a cutting board to rest for 5 to 7 minutes. Assemble and serve: Stir tomato-corn salad to mix the ingredients and taste, adjusting seasoning if needed. Once the steak has rested, cut it across the grain into 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick slices. Arrange steak fanned on a serving platter and drizzle any juices that have collected on the cutting board over it. Season lightly with additional salt and pepper. Spoon some tomato-corn salad over it, leaving the rest in a bowl on the side for adding more at the table. Eat right away.","Steak; 1 1/4- to 1 1/2-pound skirt steak; 2 tablespoons brown sugar; 1 tablespoon kosher salt; 1 teaspoon sweet or hot smoked paprika; Freshly ground black pepper; Salad; 2 ears fresh corn; 2 tablespoons olive oil; 4 tablespoons apple cider vinegar; 1 teaspoon kosher salt; Freshly ground black pepper; 1 clove garlic, minced; 4 scallions, thinly sliced (white and green); 2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved or quartered; 1 jalapeño, seeds removed, finely chopped; 1 cup finely-chopped fresh herbs such as parsley, mint, basil, chives, or a mix thereof"

Add the garlic, chili powder, salt, cumin and sauté, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes.  Mash the black bean filling.

Cut the cold cream cheese into large chunks and add to the sugar mixture and blend until completely combined and the cream cheese is soft, scraping down the bowl once or twice. Add eggs, one at a time, and blend to combine then scrape down the sides of the workbowl (yes, each time). With the third egg, add the vanilla and lemon juice too before blending and scraping down the sides one more time. Add the cream and blend to evenly combine. With a handmixer: Combine sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add softened cream cheese and beat to combine, scraping down the bowl a few times as you do to make sure there’s no unmixed cream cheese. Add eggs, one at a time, beating to combine and scraping down the bowl between each. With the third egg, add the vanilla and lemon juice too before blending and scraping down the bowl one more time. Pour in the cream, beating on low speed until combined. All methods: Pour into prepared pan, making sure it all lands inside the parchment paper sling. Transfer to oven and bake for 40 to 50 minutes or until puffed, deeply golden brown, and moderately jiggly when the pan is shimmied. [Mine registered an internal temperature of 190 to 200°F, which is much higher than a typical cheesecake but the texture was perfect.] To finish and serve: Transfer cake in loaf pan to a cooling rack and cool at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours or transfer to the fridge and cool for one hour. The cheesecake can be served cool or at room temperature; the latter is traditional but both are delicious.  Use parchment paper to lift and remove cheesecake from loaf pan and transfer to a plate. Cut into just shy of 1-inch slices.  Do ahead: Leftover basque cheesecake keeps in the fridge for 5 to 7 days. Notes:  Cream cheese temperature: For the food processor option, the cream cheese can be cold from the fridge. For the handmixer, you’ll want the cream cheese at room temperature, softened. Loaf pan size: Since, like my blueberry muffin loaf, pumpkin loaf, and others, this yields a very full loaf pan, here is my standard disclaimer about loaf pan size: Very key here is the size of your loaf pan because this will fill out every speck of it before it is done. Mine holds 6 liquid cups (or 1420 ml); it’s 8×4 inches on the bottom and 9×5 inches on the top. If yours is even slightly smaller or you’re nervous, go ahead and scoop out a little to make a muffin or two on the side. When making this for the first time, place a sheet pan underneath, just in case it spills over but I can promise you that in many tests, mine never has. Baking temperature: I tested this many, many times at both 425°F and 450°F and even as of this publication moment, I’m torn on the “best” temperature. 450°F will bake in 40 minutes, tops, and has a more dramatically dark top. But, not everyone likes theirs that dark. 425°F can take up to 50 minutes and looks the way you see it here, deeply brown in areas but not throughout. Here’s the upshot: If yours doesn’t come out as dark as you’d like it, go for the higher temperature next time. Chocolate Basque Cheesecake: My husband has been asking for a chocolate version of this forever, and I finally caved for Father’s Day. I didn’t expect to love it too, but it was excellent and gone too fast. The adjustment is simple. I melted 5.5 ounces chopped semisweet chocolate into a splash of the cream, then whisked in rest of cold cream to cool it to room temperature. Add when you add the cream in the recipe above. I skipped the lemon juice. The pan is even fuller, so be careful, but mine didn’t spill over thanks to the extended sides of the sling of parchment paper.",2/3 cup (130 grams) granulated sugar; 1/3 cup (45 grams) cornstarch; 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt; 1 pound cream cheese (2 8-ounce/227-gram packages) [see Note at end]; 3 large eggs; 2 teaspoons (10 ml) vanilla extract or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract plus 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste; 2 tablespoons (30 ml) lemon juice; 1 cup (235 ml) heavy cream
509,Beautiful courgette carbonara,"Put a large pan of salted water on to boil. Halve and then quarter any larger courgettes lengthways. Cut out and discard any fluffy middle bits, and slice the courgettes at an angle into pieces roughly the same size and shape as the penne. Smaller courgettes can simply be sliced finely. Your water will now be boiling, so add the penne to the pan and cook according to the packet instructions. To make your creamy carbonara sauce, separate the eggs and put the yolks into a bowl (saving the whites for another recipe). Add the cream and grate in half the Parmesan, and mix together with a fork. Season lightly with sea salt and black pepper, and put to one side. Heat a very large frying pan (a 35cm one is a good start – every house should have one!) and add a good splash of olive oil. Cut the pancetta or bacon into chunky lardons and fry until dark brown and crisp. Add the courgette slices and 2 big pinches of black pepper, not just to season but to give it a bit of a kick. Pick, chop and sprinkle in the thyme leaves (reserving any flowers), give everything a stir, so the courgettes become coated with all the lovely bacon-flavoured oil, and fry until they start to turn lightly golden and have softened slightly. It’s very important to get this next bit right or your carbonara could end up ruined. You need to work quickly. When the pasta is cooked, drain it, reserving a little of the cooking water. Immediately, toss the pasta in the pan with the courgettes, bacon and lovely flavours, then remove from the heat and add a ladleful of the reserved cooking water and your creamy sauce. Stir together quickly. (No more cooking now, otherwise you’ll scramble the eggs.) Get everyone around the table, ready to eat straight away. While you’re tossing the pasta and sauce, grate in the rest of the Parmesan and add a little more of the cooking water if needed, to give you a silky and shiny sauce. Taste quickly for seasoning. If you’ve managed to get any courgette flowers, tear them over the top, then serve and eat immediately, as the sauce can become thick and stodgy if left too long.","6 medium green and yellow courgettes; 500 g penne; 4 large eggs; 100 ml single cream; 1 small handful of Parmesan cheese; olive oil; 6 slices of back bacon; ½ a bunch of fresh thyme , (15g); a few courgette flowers , (optional)"
510,Slow Cooker Potato Soup,"Wash and dice the celery stalks, peel and dice the carrots, dice the onion, and mince the garlic. Wash, peel, and chop the potatoes into ½ – ¾ inch chunks. Add the potatoes, carrots, celery, onion, and the garlic to a 5 or 6 quart slow cooker or crock pot. Then add the Italian seasoning, salt, and freshly cracked black pepper to the slow cooker.  Pour the chicken broth over the vegetables and spices in the slow cooker. Stir all the ingredients together so that everything is evenly distributed. Place the lid on the slow cooker and cook on high for 3 hours. Once the potatoes are almost finished cooking, make a quick flour slurry by adding the flour and water to a small bowl and whisking together until smooth and there are no lumps. After the potato soup has cooked for 3 hours, check to make sure the potatoes are tender and can be easily pierced with a fork. Now add the slurry, heavy cream, and sour cream to the slow cooker. Stir well to combine, replace the lid, and continue to cook on high for an additional 10 minutes. During the last 10 minutes of cooking, while the slurry and heavy cream are thickening the soup, shred the cheddar cheese and slice the green onions. Remove the slow cooker lid then use a potato masher to mash the potato chunks into smaller pieces. Add ½ cup of the shredded cheese and half of the sliced green onions. Stir until the cheese has melted into the soup. Taste the soup and adjust the salt or black pepper to your liking. Use the remaining shredded cheese and green onions to garnish individual bowls. Serve hot and enjoy!","2 stalks celery; 2 carrots; 1 yellow onion; 3 cloves garlic; 3 lbs Yukon gold potatoes; 1 tsp Italian seasoning; 1 1/4 tsp salt; 1/2 tsp  freshly cracked black pepper; 3 cups chicken broth; 2 Tbsp all-purpose flour; 2 Tbsp water; 1/2 cup heavy cream; 1/2 cup sour cream; 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese, divided; 3 green onions, sliced & divided"
511,Non-nuclear fire noodles,"Mix the gochujang, sriracha, chicken bouillon powder, grated garlic, light soy, sugar and sesame oil together in a jug (pitcher). Bring a pot of water to the boil and cook the noodles according to the packet instructions. Add 4 tablespoons of the noodle water to the jug, then strain the noodles and rinse with cool water, separating the noodles with your fingers, to prevent them from sticking. Set aside. Heat the oil in a non-stick, heavy-based frying pan (skillet). Add the chicken pieces and sear on all sides. Once sealed, pour in the sauce from the jug and allow it to bubble away for 2–3 minutes or until the chicken is just cooked through. Add the noodles and spring onions (scallions), tossing to coat. Divide the noodles between two bowls. Make a little dent in the middle of each and plop in an egg yolk, if using. Sprinkle with the torn nori and crispy garlic and serve immediately.","1 tablespoon gochujang; 1 tablespoon sriracha , (or your favourite fruity hot sauce); ½ tablespoon chicken bouillon powder; 1 clove of garlic , grated; ½ tablespoon light soy sauce; ½ tablespoon golden caster (superfine) sugar; ½ tablespoon toasted sesame oil; 2 nests ramen noodles , (fresh or dried); 1 tablespoon neutral oil; 2 boneless chicken thighs , finely sliced; 2 spring onions (scallions) , finely sliced; 2 egg yolks , (optional); ½ a toasted nori sheet , torn into small pieces; 1 tablespoon crispy fried garlic"

513,French Onion Burgers,"Make Horseradish Aioli by mixing the ingredients together in a bowl at least 30 minutes (or up to 2 weeks) before assembling burgers. Season and form patties: Sprinkle the onion soup mix all over the ground beef and use your hands to gently mix it into the meat (be careful not to over-mix the meat). Divide into 6 equal portions and gently form into ½ inch thick patties that are wider than the burger buns (as they will shrink). Use your thumb to press an indentation into the center of each patty. Cover and set aside. Make caramelized onions: Melt butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add onions to the pan in an even layer and leave them until they begin to brown. Once they start to brown on the bottom, stir in sugar and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally until browned, about 15 minutes. Grill burgers: Preheat grill to medium high heat. Place patties on hot grill, indent-side up. Close grill lid and cook for 3-4 minutes, until the bottom of the burger is seared and juices are accumulating on top of the burger. Flip and cook an additional 3-4 minutes or until cooked to desired doneness (130-150 degrees). Add cheese on burgers during the last minute of cooking. Remove to a plate and allow to rest for a few minutes before assembling. Assemble: Toast burger buns if desired and place a spoonful of aioli on the buns. Top with burger patty, bacon, caramelized onions and arugula or lettuce, then top bun.

514,Pimento Cheese,"In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer, combine the cheddar, cream cheese, pimento peppers, mayonnaise, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper and jalapeño (if using), and several twists of black pepper. Beat the mixture together with a hand mixer, your stand mixer, or by hand with a sturdy wooden spoon or spatula. Beat until the mixture is thoroughly combined. Taste, and add more black pepper if desired, and/or salt for more overall flavor (I usually add a pinch of two). If you’d like your pimento cheese to have more of a kick, add another pinch of cayenne. Blend again. Transfer the mixture to a smaller serving bowl. Serve your pimento cheese immediately, or chill it in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Pimento cheese hardens as it cools; let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature to soften.","2 cups freshly grated extra-sharp Cheddar cheese; 8 ounces cream cheese, cut into 1” cubes and softened at room temperature*; 4 ounces pimento peppers**, well drained and chopped if in strips; 2 tablespoons mayonnaise (Duke’s is traditional but I also like Sir Kensington’s); ¼ teaspoon garlic powder; ¼ teaspoon onion powder; ¼ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (decrease or omit if sensitive to spice); ½ medium jalapeño pepper, ribs and seeds removed, and minced (about 1 tablespoon; omit if sensitive to spice); Freshly ground black pepper, to taste; Salt, to taste"
515,Peach Brussels Sprouts Crunch Salad,"In a small bowl mix together tahini, lemon juice, maple syrup/honey, dijon mustard, poppyseeds, onion powder, salt and water to thin the dressing. Taste and add more maple syrup or honey if you like your poppyseed dressing a bit sweeter. Next, shred the brussels sprouts by using a food processor with the slicing attachment and pulse until the brussels sprouts are thinly sliced. If you don’t have a food processor, feel free to use a sharp knife to thinly slice. You also have the option of buying already shredded/shaved brussels sprouts in a bag from the store. Add brussels to a large bowl and pour the dressing all over. Use tongs to coat the brussels with the dressing. Let the dressing sit and marinate the brussels for 10-15 minutes. While the brussels marinate and soak up the dressing, you can chop and prep all your other ingredients. Finally make your nut crunch mixture: place sliced almonds and pumpkin seeds in a skillet over medium heat. Toast for 3-5 minutes, stirring frequently until they turn slightly golden brown and fragrant, then turn off heat and immediately add in maple syrup and a pinch of sea salt. Stir for 30 more seconds to coat, then transfer to a plate or piece of parchment paper to cool for a few minutes. Some of the nuts will slightly stick together but this is what we want for the ‘nut crunch’ in the salad. Allow to cool for 5 minutes. Add the sliced peaches to the brussels salad along with the nut crunch mixture and feta crumbles and toss to combine. Enjoy!","1 batch tahini poppy seed dressing; For the salad:; 1 pound brussels sprouts, outer yellow leaves and stems removed, and shredded; 2 cups sliced peaches (from about 2 large or 3 medium peaches); ⅓ cup feta crumbles (optional but delicious!); For the nut crunch mixture:; ⅓ cup sliced almonds; 1/4 cup raw pepitas (pumpkin seeds); ½ tablespoon pure maple syrup; Sea salt"
516,Summer Bean Gribiche,"Working in batches by type (thick beans will take longer than thin ones), cook 1 lb. mixed snap beans (such as green, wax, and/or Romano), trimmed, in a large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, 2–6 minutes per batch, depending on type. Using tongs, transfer to a large bowl of ice water and let cool. Using a slotted spoon and working one at a time, carefully lower 5 large eggs into same pot of boiling water. Cook, adjusting heat as needed to maintain a simmer, 9 minutes. Transfer eggs to bowl of ice water with beans; let cool.

517,Grilled Green Beans,"In a large mixing bowl, combine green beans, oil, salt and pepper (and any optional seasonings). Toss. Optional: Allow to marinate 15-30 minutes. Preheat grill to medium heat. Brush grate with oil. Add green beans to grate, horizontally or at an angle. (You can also use a grill basket for ease, but we love the grill marks.) Grill 4 minutes until slightly charred and rotate. Grill 3-4 minutes longer after turning, and remove from heat.","1 pound green beans fresh, trimmed; ¼ cup olive oil extra virgin; ¼ teaspoon pepper fresh ground, largest flake; salt to taste"
518,Japanese Eggplant With Cashews and Chiles,"Preheat oven to 425°. Using the tip of your knife, lightly score cut sides of 6 medium Japanese eggplants (about 1½ lb.), halved lengthwise, spacing cuts ¼"" apart and creating a crosshatch pattern. Place, cut side up, on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle ⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil over; season with kosher salt. Roast until lightly browned and tender, 20–30 minutes, depending on thickness. Heat broiler (leave eggplant in oven). Broil eggplant until browned on top, 3–6 minutes (watch carefully; depending on your broiler, this could happen very quickly or take more time). Meanwhile, cook 10 garlic cloves, thinly sliced, and remaining ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat, swirling occasionally, until garlic is barely golden and crisp, 6–9 minutes.

523,Sweet vanilla risotto with poached peaches and chocolate,"When you halve the peaches, leave the stones in – they will come away a lot more easily after they have been cooked. Put them into a small pan with 4 tablespoons of the sugar, the cinnamon stick and the zest and juice of the orange. Put a lid on top and slowly simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes, until the peach skin and stones can be easily removed. You don't want to cook them to pulp – they should be soft but should still hold their shape. Remove from the heat and put to one side. In an appropriately sized high-sided, thick-bottomed pan with a lid, slowly melt two-thirds of the butter. Score down the length of the vanilla pods and remove the seeds by scraping a knife down the inside of each half. Add the seeds to the butter and stir. Continue to cook for 1 minute before adding your rice with the remaining sugar. Turn the heat up to medium, stir the rice, and add the wine, continuing to stir until it has almost cooked away. Now add the milk little by little. Keep the rice on a slow but constant simmer for about 16 or 17 minutes and stir it as often as you can. In this way you can massage the starch out of the rice and this will give you a silky, oozy end product, much like the classic Italian risotto. When the rice has cooked through it should be soft yet still holding its shape. You may need to add a little more milk or water just to adjust the consistency. Remove from the heat, add the grated white chocolate and the rest of the butter, then stir, place a lid on top and leave for a few minutes. Remove the skin and stones from the peaches, discard them along with the cinnamon stick, and take the peaches to the table with your block of dark chocolate, snapped into small pieces. Spoon the risotto on to plates, then push a couple of pieces of dark chocolate into the middle of each one. Just so you know, a perfect risotto should slowly creep and ooze to the side of your plate, so don't worry if it starts to spread out! Gently tear the peaches and place some on each plate, then drizzle over some of the lovely juice and sprinkle over a few mint leaves. By the time you go to eat it, the dark chocolate will have melted. Joy joy joy!","6 ripe peaches , halved; 6 tablespoons caster sugar; ½ stick cinnamon; 1 orange , zest and juice of; 3 tablespoons butter; 2 vanilla pods; 325 g risotto rice; 1 wineglass white wine; 1 litre full fat milk , preferably organic; 100 g good-quality white chocolate , grated; 100 g good-quality dark chocolate (70% cocoa solids); 1 handful fresh mint , leaves picked"
524,Kalamata White Bean Dip,"Combine all of the ingredients in a food processor. Blend until smooth.  Taste and add another pinch of salt if the flavor needs a boost. Transfer to a serving bowl and top with a light drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of basil, if using.  Leftovers will keep well in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 4 days.","1 can (15 ounces) cannellini or Great Northern beans, rinsed and drained, or 1 ½ cups cooked beans; 1 tablespoon Kalamata olive brine; ⅔ cup pitted Kalamata olives, well-drained; 1 clove garlic, roughly chopped; Tiny pinch of fine salt; 3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for serving; 10 twists of freshly ground black pepper ; Optional garnish: A couple of fresh basil leaves, very thinly sliced; For serving: Crostini, pita chips, crusty bread, or crudités like carrots, cucumber and bell pepper, for serving"
525,Easy Basque Cheesecake,"Heat oven to 425°F (218°C). Line a loaf pan (see Note at the end about size) with one big piece of parchment paper pressed into the corners and up the sides. I leave the excess paper extended up over the rim, which also helps protect you against overflow. Place loaf pan on a rimmed baking sheet, just in case there’s overflow (but I’ve never had any).  In a food processor or high-speed blender: Blend the sugar, cornstarch, and salt into the empty workbowl to combine. (Make sure the lid is on or the cornstarch will escape in a cloud of dust.) Cut the cold cream cheese into large chunks and add to the sugar mixture and blend until completely combined and the cream cheese is soft, scraping down the bowl once or twice. Add eggs, one at a time, and blend to combine then scrape down the sides of the workbowl (yes, each time). With the third egg, add the vanilla and lemon juice too before blending and scraping down the sides one more time. Add the cream and blend to evenly combine. With a handmixer: Combine sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add softened cream cheese and beat to combine, scraping down the bowl a few times as you do to make sure there’s no unmixed cream cheese. Add eggs, one at a time, beating to combine and scraping down the bowl between each. With the third egg, add the vanilla and lemon juice too before blending and scraping down the bowl one more time. Pour in the cream, beating on low speed until combined. All methods: Pour into prepared pan, making sure it all lands inside the parchment paper sling. Transfer to oven and bake for 40 to 50 minutes or until puffed, deeply golden brown, and moderately jiggly when the pan is shimmied. [Mine registered an internal temperature of 190 to 200°F, which is much higher than a typical cheesecake but the texture was perfect.] To finish and serve: Transfer cake in loaf pan to a cooling rack and cool at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours or transfer to the fridge and cool for one hour. The cheesecake can be served cool or at room temperature; the latter is traditional but both are delicious.  Use parchment paper to lift and remove cheesecake from loaf pan and transfer to a plate. Cut into just shy of 1-inch slices.  Do ahead: Leftover basque cheesecake keeps in the fridge for 5 to 7 days. Notes:  Cream cheese temperature: For the food processor option, the cream cheese can be cold from the fridge. For the handmixer, you’ll want the cream cheese at room temperature, softened. Loaf pan size: Since, like my blueberry muffin loaf, pumpkin loaf, and others, this yields a very full loaf pan, here is my standard disclaimer about loaf pan size: Very key here is the size of your loaf pan because this will fill out every speck of it before it is done. Mine holds 6 liquid cups (or 1420 ml); it’s 8×4 inches on the bottom and 9×5 inches on the top. If yours is even slightly smaller or you’re nervous, go ahead and scoop out a little to make a muffin or two on the side. When making this for the first time, place a sheet pan underneath, just in case it spills over but I can promise you that in many tests, mine never has. Baking temperature: I tested this many, many times at both 425°F and 450°F and even as of this publication moment, I’m torn on the “best” temperature. 450°F will bake in 40 minutes, tops, and has a more dramatically dark top. But, not everyone likes theirs that dark. 425°F can take up to 50 minutes and looks the way you see it here, deeply brown in areas but not throughout. Here’s the upshot: If yours doesn’t come out as dark as you’d like it, go for the higher temperature next time. Chocolate Basque Cheesecake: My husband has been asking for a chocolate version of this forever, and I finally caved for Father’s Day. I didn’t expect to love it too, but it was excellent and gone too fast. The adjustment is simple. I melted 5.5 ounces chopped semisweet chocolate into a splash of the cream, then whisked in rest of cold cream to cool it to room temperature. Add when you add the cream in the recipe above. I skipped the lemon juice. The pan is even fuller, so be careful, but mine didn’t spill over thanks to the extended sides of the sling of parchment paper.",2/3 cup (130 grams) granulated sugar; 1/3 cup (45 grams) cornstarch; 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt; 1 pound cream cheese (2 8-ounce/227-gram packages) [see Note at end]; 3 large eggs; 2 teaspoons (10 ml) vanilla extract or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract plus 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste; 2 tablespoons (30 ml) lemon juice; 1 cup (235 ml) heavy cream
526,Cardamom Scones,"Prep the oven and baking sheet. Heat the oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Make the dough. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, baking powder and salt until evenly combined. Use a pastry cutter (or your fingers) to cut the butter into the dough until it resembles coarse cornmeal. Create a well in the center of the bowl, add the half and half, 1 egg and vanilla extract. Then use a fork to briefly whisk the wet ingredients together. Whisk the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until a dough begins to form. Use your hands to bring the dough together and knead the dough a few times until a ball can be formed. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Make the cardamom-cinnamon-sugar. In a separate bowl, whisk the cardamom, cinnamon and 2 tablespoons sugar together until combined. Layer the scones. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into a roughly 8×11-inch rectangle (the size of a sheet of paper). Sprinkle half of the cinnamon-sugar mixture over the dough and lightly press it down with your hands (see video), then fold the dough in half. Use the rolling pin to roll the dough out lightly into an 6×10-inch rectangle. Sprinkle the remaining cinnamon-sugar over the dough, then fold in half once more. Use your hands to lightly press down the dough to seal the edges, then shape the dough roughly into a 6-inch circle. Use a sharp knife to slice the dough into 6 pie wedges and transfer them to the prepared baking sheet. Top the scones. Whisk the egg white together with 1 tablespoon of water until lightly frothy. Brush the egg wash evenly over the tops of the scones to coat, then sprinkle the remaining sugar on top. Bake. Bake for 15 minutes or until the scones are slightly golden around the edges. Transfer to a wire baking rack to cool. Make the glaze. Meanwhile, whisk together the glaze ingredients until combined. (If it seems too thick, add in more liquid. If it’s too thin, add in more powdered sugar.) Once the scones have cooled to room temperature, drizzle them with the glaze. Serve. Serve immediately and enjoy!","1 3/4 cups (230 g) all-purpose flour; 1/3 cup granulated white sugar, divided; 1 tablespoon baking powder; 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt; 1/2 cup (8 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, diced; 1/3 cup half and half; 1 large egg + 1 egg white; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract; 2 teaspoons ground cardamom; 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon; 1/2 cup powdered sugar; 1 tablespoon half and half"
527,Peanut Butter Banana Smoothie,"Add the sliced banana, peanut butter, brown sugar, vanilla extract, and milk to a blender. Blend the ingredients until smooth.

528,Boursin Cheese Pasta,"Bring a pot of water to a boil over high heat. Prepare pasta al dente. Drain pasta and return to pot. Over low heat, toss pasta with boursin to melt. Serve immediately. Optional: Garnish with fresh chives, basil, thyme or parsley.","16 ounces pasta Penne or your favorite type; 1 cup boursin (about a 5.3 ounce package); 1 tablespoon fresh chives optional, chopped"
529,Black bean burgers,"Peel the onion, finely slice into rounds and place in a small bowl with the balsamic and a pinch of sea salt. Set aside. Halve, deseed and finely chop the chilli. Trim and finely chop the spring onions. Place both in a mixing bowl. Drain the beans and pat dry with kitchen paper. Add to the bowl, along with the breadcrumbs. Season, then scrunch the bean mixture together with clean hands. Divide into 3 balls, flatten into patties and place 2 in the fridge to chill for 10 minutes (wrap and freeze the spare for another day). In a small bowl, combine half the lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and the yoghurt. Season well. Trim the kale and mix into the dressing with the rocket. Put aside. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a non-stick pan over a medium heat. When the pan is hot, fry the burgers for 4 minutes on each side, or until golden. If they colour too quickly, reduce the heat. Slice the tomato and mozzarella into rounds and open the buns. When the burgers are almost cooked, top each one with mozzarella. Cover the burgers with a lid for 2 minutes to melt the cheese. Set another pan over a high heat and warm the bun halves, cut-side down, for 2 minutes or until toasted. Lift the onions out of the balsamic with a fork. Pop slices of tomato on each bun base, and a burger on top. Top with the balsamic onions and the bun lid. Serve the kale salad alongside.",½ a red onion; 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar; 1 fresh red chilli; 2 spring onions; 1 x 400 g tin black beans; 100 g fresh breadcrumbs; 1 lemon; extra virgin olive oil; 2 tablespoons natural yoghurt; 80 g baby kale; 30 g rocket; olive oil; 1 ripe beef tomato; 75 g mozzarella cheese; 2 wholemeal buns
530,12-minute spaghettini,"Place a pan of salted water on a high heat and bring to the boil. Peel and finely slice 2 cloves of garlic, halve 250g of mixed-colour ripe cherry tomatoes, destone 1 handful of black olives and pick the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh basil (15g). Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil into a large frying pan over a high heat, add the garlic and fry for 1 minute, then throw in the tomatoes and fry gently for 1 further minute, or until they are starting to break down a little. Tear in the olives and basil, saving the baby leaves to garnish, then add a splash of water, turn the heat down a little and continue to simmer gently until needed. Cook 160g of dried spaghettini or taglierini in the pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions, then drain, reserving a mugful of cooking water. Tip the pasta back into the pan, with the sauce and toss together, loosening with a splash of cooking water, if needed. Season to taste with sea salt and black pepper, then scatter with 20g of finely grated salted ricotta or a crumbling of feta and the reserved basil leaves.","2 cloves of garlic; 250 g mixed-colour ripe cherry tomatoes; 1 handful of black olives , (stone in); olive oil; ½ a bunch of fresh basil , (15g); 160 g dried spaghettini or taglierini; 20 g salted ricotta or feta cheese"
531,Kalamata White Bean Dip,"Combine all of the ingredients in a food processor. Blend until smooth.  Taste and add another pinch of salt if the flavor needs a boost. Transfer to a serving bowl and top with a light drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of basil, if using.  Leftovers will keep well in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 4 days.","1 can (15 ounces) cannellini or Great Northern beans, rinsed and drained, or 1 ½ cups cooked beans; 1 tablespoon Kalamata olive brine; ⅔ cup pitted Kalamata olives, well-drained; 1 clove garlic, roughly chopped; Tiny pinch of fine salt; 3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for serving; 10 twists of freshly ground black pepper ; Optional garnish: A couple of fresh basil leaves, very thinly sliced; For serving: Crostini, pita chips, crusty bread, or crudités like carrots, cucumber and bell pepper, for serving"
532,Perfect Blueberry Muffin Loaf,"Heat oven to 375°F. Line a loaf pan (see Note up top about size) with one big piece of parchment paper pressed into the corners and up the sides, as shown here. I leave the excess paper extended up over the rim, which also helps protect you against overflow. Melt butter in a large bowl, then whisk in granulated sugar and zest. Add yogurt and eggs and whisk to evenly combine. Sprinkle surface of batter with baking powder, baking soda, and salt and whisk thoroughly into the batter, several times more around the bowl than is necessary for it to look mixed. Add flour and berries and use a flexible spatula or spoon to mix them in so that no pockets of flour remain. Batter will be very, very thick. Spoon into prepared loaf pan and drop it on the counter a few times to make sure there no air pockets. Smooth the top and sprinkle it with turbinado sugar. It will seem like way too much but I beg you not to skimp at all; the batter is not very sweet but the crunchy top the sugar provides is one of the best parts. Bake for 60 to 70 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into a few places in the loaf come out batter-free. If your berries were frozen going in, this might even need 5 additional minutes. Remove from oven and let cool in pan. Use parchment paper to lift it out of the pan and cut into thick slices. Do ahead: I use the parchment paper to transfer leftovers back to the loaf pan. Store at room temperature for 3 to 4 days, longer in the fridge. I keep the loaf uncovered/unwrapped which allows the top to retain its crunch. The sides are kept from drying out by the parchment and loaf. The loaf freezes well, wrapped tightly. P.S. Yes, of course you can use any other kind of berry here. I tested a few rounds with frozen mixed berry mixes, and as long as the strawberries aren’t comically huge (I chopped ones that were), it works great.","8 tablespoons (1/2 cup or 115 grams) unsalted butter, cold is fine; 3/4 cup (150 grams) granulated sugar; Finely grated zest from one lemon; 1 cup (225 grams) plain unsweetened Greek-style yogurt; 2 large eggs; 2 teaspoons baking powder; 1/2 teaspoon baking soda; 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt; 2 cups (260 grams) all-purpose flour; 2 1/4 cups (320 grams or 11.5 ounces) fresh or frozen blueberries (no need to defrost); 3 tablespoons (35 grams) turbinado sugar (sugar in the raw)"

534,Egg tortilla wrap,"Tip the flour into a mixing bowl, add a pinch of sea salt, then make a well in the middle. Pour in 50ml of warm water and 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then use a fork to bring in the flour from the outside to form a dough – when the dough starts to come together, dust your hands with flour and pat it into a ball. Knead on a flour-dusted surface for a few minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Leave to rest for 30 minutes. Deseed the tomato and roughly chop three-quarters of it, trim and finely slice 2 spring onions and deseed and finely chop the pepper, then scrape into a bowl. Tear in the basil leaves, drizzle with 1 teaspoon each of olive oil and red wine vinegar, then toss together and season to taste. Peel and destone the avocado (if needed), scoop into a bowl, then mash with a fork. Trim the remaining spring onion and finely dice with the leftover tomato, then stir into the avocado.

539,Southern-Style Caramel Cake,"Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 325°. Lightly butter two 8""-diameter cake pans with unsalted butter. Line bottoms with parchment paper rounds. Mix 2 cups (250 g) bleached cake flour, 1½ cups (300 g) granulated sugar, 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt, 1½ tsp. baking powder, and ½ tsp. baking soda in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Add ¾ cup (1½ sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into 1"" pieces, increase speed to medium-low, and beat until mixture resembles wet sand, about 1 minute. Add 1 cup buttermilk and 1 tsp. vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract and beat until batter is pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes (this extended mix time builds structure and prevents the cake from sinking; don’t worry about overmixing). Working one at a time, add 3 large eggs, beating 30 seconds after additions and scraping down sides and bottom of bowl with a rubber spatula as needed; batter should be smooth and creamy at the end. Scrape batter into prepared pans, dividing equally (about 530 g per pan); smooth surface with an offset spatula. Bake cakes until golden and tops spring back when gently pressed (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should register 205°), 30–35 minutes. (Cakes may shrink slightly from edges of pan.) Transfer pans to a wire rack and let cakes cool in pans 10–15 minutes. Run an offset spatula around sides of cakes to loosen, then invert onto rack (leave parchment rounds attached). Let cakes cool completely. Cook ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature, in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring often, until it foams, then browns, 5–8 minutes. Add 2 cups (packed; 400 g) dark brown sugar and ½ cup heavy cream (stand back; mixture will spatter). Cook, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Scrape into the clean bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add 2 cups (220 g) powdered sugar and 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt to caramel mixture and beat on medium-low speed until smooth and cooled to lukewarm, 6–8 minutes. Cut remaining ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature, into 3 or 4 pieces and add to frosting one at a time, beating to blend after each addition and scraping down bottom and sides of bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. (Frosting should be smooth and creamy with the texture of runny peanut butter.) Add 2 tsp. distilled white vinegar and beat to incorporate. Use frosting while it is still slightly warm or it will become too firm to work with. Peel parchment rounds away from cakes and discard. Place 1 cake layer, right side up, on a cake stand or large plate (use a cake turntable if you’ve got one; it will make frosting easier). Scoop 1 cup frosting (eyeballing is fine) on top and spread evenly with an offset spatula, pushing almost to edges. Place second cake layer, upside down, on top. Working quickly, spread sides and top of cake evenly with remaining frosting. Using a spoon or offset spatula, create decorative swirls in frosting if desired. Lightly sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Let cake sit at room temperature at least 15 minutes to allow frosting to firm up slightly before serving. Do Ahead: Cake can be assembled 12 hours ahead. Cover with a cake dome or an inverted bowl and store at a cool room temperature.","¾ cup (1½ sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into 1"" pieces, plus more for pans; 2 cups (250 g) bleached cake flour; 1½ cups (300 g) granulated sugar; 1½ tsp.
