Turn the heat down and cook very gently with the lid on for 10 minutes, or until the onion has softened, but not browned. Add the potato and stock and bring to the boil. Simmer for 10 minutes or until the potato is cooked. Next, drop in the peas and watercress and simmer for a further 5 minutes until the peas are cooked. Remove the pan from the heat.
