{"name":"Granola Dust energy balls","description":"These super-nutritious Granola Dust energy balls are perfect for snacking on the go.","ingredients":["200 g Granola Dust","1 tablespoon runny honey","1 heaped tablespoon cocoa powder","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","1 orange"],"instructions":"Put 2 tablespoons of Granola Dust aside in a shallow bowl or airtight container and set aside. Place the remaining Granola Dust in a food processor with the honey, cocoa powder and vanilla extract, then zest in the orange and squeeze in half of the juice. Blitz for 1 to 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides a couple of times, and adding an extra squeeze of orange juice to bind, if needed – it takes a while for the mixture to come together, so be patient and let the processor work its magic. With wet hands, divide into 18 and roll into balls, dropping them into the remaining Granola Dust as you go. Shake to coat, storing them in the excess dust until needed. They’ll keep happily for up to 2 weeks in an airtight container.","tags":["Fruit","Snacks","Healthy snack ideas","Healthy vegetarian recipes","Prep & go recipes"],"time":{"prep":"","cook":"Time 25 minutes","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"Time 25 minutes"},"servings":"Makes 18","image":"https://cdn.jamieoliver.com/recipe-database/medium/124048426.jpg"}
