{"name":"Salsa Poached Eggs","description":"These salsa poached eggs are like a southwest spin on shakshuka. Eggs poached in a rich and flavorful tomato sauce with green chiles.","ingredients":["1 yellow onion","2 cloves garlic","2 Tbsp olive oil","1 15oz. can fire-roasted diced tomatoes","1 4oz. can diced green chiles","2 Tbsp tomato paste","1/2 tsp cumin","1/8 tsp cayenne","1/2 tsp salt","1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper","1/2 cup water","4 large eggs","2 green onions, sliced","2 Tbsp chopped cilantro (optional)"],"instructions":"Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add both to a deep skillet with the olive oil and saut√© over medium heat until the onions are soft. Add the diced tomatoes (with juices), green chiles (with juices), tomato paste, cumin, cayenne, salt, pepper, and water. Stir to combine. Allow the salsa to come up to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Let the salsa simmer for about ten minutes, or until it is slightly thickened. Use the back of a spoon to make four indentations in the sauce. Crack one egg into each indentation. Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat down to medium-low, and let the eggs simmer in the sauce for 7-10 minutes, or until they reach your desired doneness (less time for runny yolks, more time for solid yolks). Once the eggs are cooked, garnish with sliced green onion and chopped cilantro, then serve with tortilla chips or over a bowl of grits.","tags":[],"time":{"prep":"5 minutes mins","cook":"20 minutes mins","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"25 minutes mins"},"servings":"4","image":"https://www.budgetbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Salsa-Poached-Eggs-close.jpg"}
