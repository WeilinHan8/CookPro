This will help them soften up and perfect for blending. While the dates are soaking you can get all your other ingredients out, measured and ready. Add all ingredients to a high powered blender: frozen cherries, lime zest, lime juice, pitted dates, greek yogurt, vanilla, milk, and ice. Feel free to add any optional add-ins to your smoothie if you’d like. Blend until smooth, adding more milk to thin, if necessary. Pour into a glass and enjoy!","tags":[],"time":{"prep":"10 minutes minutes","cook":" ","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"10 minutes minutes"},"servings":"1","image":"https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Smoothie-FB.png"}
