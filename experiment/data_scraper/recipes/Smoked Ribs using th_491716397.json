{"name":"Smoked Ribs using the 3-2-1 Method","description":"These instructions for smoking pork spareribs and baby back ribs, using the 3-2-1 method, create tender fall off the bone ribs. Cooked in Bradley Smoker","ingredients":["2 racks pork ribs","1 cup Steve's BBQ rub","1/2 cup beer, pop or apple juice","1 1/2 cups BBQ sauce"],"instructions":"Peel the membrane off the back of each rack of ribs. Generously rub the BBQ spice rub all over the ribs. These are directions to smoke the ribs in a smoker.Set the smoker to 225F and use your wood of choice (I use hickory and apple most often). Place the ribs in the smoker and smoke for 3 hours if they are spareribs and 2 hours if they are back ribs. After the ribs have been in the smoker for 3 hours, take them out and wrap each rack with aluminum foil. Pour a 1/4 cup of beer, pop or apple juice with each rack of ribs. Fold over the foil and pinch all the edges to ensure that it is sealed well to allow steaming. If your smoker can function as an oven (like Bradley smokers) place the ribs wrapped in foil back in the smoker for another 2 hours. It is also possible to use an oven for this stage. Have it set for 225F and bake them for 2 hours. After these 2 hours, remove the ribs carefully from the foil. Generously coat the ribs in your favourite BBQ sauce. Put them back in the smoker set for 225F for 1 final hour. It is also possible to use the oven for this stage.","tags":[],"time":{"prep":"15 minutes minutes","cook":"6 hours hours","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"6 hours hours 15 minutes minutes"},"servings":"8","image":"https://www.theblackpeppercorn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Smoking-Ribs-3-2-1-in-Electric-Smoker-3.jpg"}
