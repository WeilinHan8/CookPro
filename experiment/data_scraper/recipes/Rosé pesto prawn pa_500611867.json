{"name":"Rose패 pesto prawn pasta","description":"With beautiful king prawns, lots of garlic and a big kiss of rose패, this angel-hair pasta is perfect for warm summer evenings. Absolute joy. ","ingredients":["300 g large raw shell-on king prawns , from sustainable sources","4 cloves of garlic","2 heaped teaspoons red pesto","150 g dried taglierini or angel-hair pasta","150 ml light rose패 wine"],"instructions":"Place 4 whole prawns in a large non-stick frying pan with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, off the heat. Pull off the rest of the prawn heads and chuck them into the pan for bonus flavour. Quickly pull the legs and tails off the prawns and peel off the shells. Run the tip of your knife down their backs and pull out the vein, then chop the prawns. Peel and finely slice the garlic. Put the frying pan on a medium-high heat and, after 2 minutes, stir in the garlic and chopped prawns, followed 1 minute later by the pesto, stirring regularly. Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions. Pour the rose패 into the prawn pan and let it bubble and reduce for 1 minute. Drain the pasta, reserving a mugful of cooking water, then toss the pasta into the prawn pan, loosening with a little reserved cooking water, if needed. Toss over the heat for 1 minute, then taste, season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper, and dish up.","tags":["Seafood","Romantic meals","Dinner for two","Prawns"],"time":{"prep":"","cook":"Time 12 minutes","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"Time 12 minutes"},"servings":"Serves 2","image":"https://cdn.jamieoliver.com/recipe-database/medium/107865056.jpg"}
