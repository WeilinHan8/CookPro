{"name":"Super Yummy Chicken Salad","description":"This Chicken Salad is so good! Protein-packed with a delicious creamy dressing, and perfect for an on-the-go lunch in a sandwich or wrap.","ingredients":["1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt (I prefer 2% milkfat or higher)","1/4 cup mayo","1 tablespoon Dijon mustard","2 teaspoons sugar (more or less to taste – and honey also works!)","3/4 teaspoon kosher salt","3/4 teaspoon onion powder","1/2 teaspoon garlic powder","2 1/2 cups cooked chicken, cubed or diced (I use rotisserie chicken breast)","1 1/2 cups red grapes, sliced","1 cup finely diced celery (about 2-3 stalks)","1 cup roasted cashew halves and pieces","any extra seasonings you like (dried herbs, fresh herbs, salt and pepper, etc. – I typically add dried chives!)"],"instructions":"Dressing: Whisk the dressing ingredients until smooth. Taste and adjust, keeping in mind that it should taste salty / concentrated as it will distribute amongst all the other ingredients. Mix: Toss your mix-ins (chicken, grapes, celery, and cashews) with as much of the dressing as you like. Season: Taste, adjust, and zhuzh to your heart’s content. I usually stir in some freeze-dried chives and white pepper.  You’re Done! Yum! Eat on a whole wheat wrap, lettuce wrap, sandwich, toast, dipped with crackers or just PLAIN! Delicious, cold, creamy, I love it. Store leftovers in an airtight container the fridge for up to 4 days.","tags":["All Recipes","Recipes","Gluten-Free","Healthy","Lunch","Meal Prep","Meat and Chicken","Quick and Easy","Salads","Sandwiches"],"time":{"prep":"15 minutes","cook":"0 minutes","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"15 minutes"},"servings":"6 servings","image":"https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Super-Amazing-Chicken-Salad.jpg"}
