Cook in the hot pan for 3 minutes on each side, or until dark, gnarly and cooked through. Cook the noodles in a large pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions. Trim the broccoli (halving any thick stalks lengthways) and add to the water for the last 2 minutes. Remove the chicken to a board. Use tongs to carefully drag the just-cooked noodles and broccoli with a bit of their water straight into the frying pan.
