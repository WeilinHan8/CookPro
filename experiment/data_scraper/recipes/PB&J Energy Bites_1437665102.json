{"name":"PB&J Energy Bites","description":"Delicious peanut butter and jelly energy bites made with simple ingredients for a protein-packed snack to keep in your fridge or freezer!","ingredients":["1 cup pitted soft large Medjool dates (about 10-12 large dates)","½ cup natural creamy peanut butter","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","½ cup rolled oats, gluten free if desired","⅓ cup fine shredded unsweetened coconut","¼ cup (about 1 scoop) vanilla or unflavored protein powder of choice (or sub flaxseed meal or almond flour)","1 cup freeze dried strawberries"],"instructions":"In the bowl of a food processor, add the dates, peanut butter and vanilla and pulse until ingredients are well combined and sticky, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. You may need to scrape down the sides a few times with a spatula, then process again. Add in the oats, coconut, protein powder and freeze dried strawberries and process again. The mixture may seem crumbly at first, but see if you can squeeze a little bit between your fingers and if it sticks, you should be able to form it into balls. Use your hands to roll 1 tablespoon balls of dough. If you choose to roll these in a topping, you can roll them in crushed or blended/finely processed freeze dried strawberries. Another option is to roll them into toasted coconut or even drizzle with melted dark chocolate for a sweet treat – up to you. Place in a reusable silicone ziptop bag and store in the fridge for 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 3 months. They’re actually delicious straight out of the freezer, too!","tags":[],"time":{"prep":"10 minutes minutes","cook":" ","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"10 minutes minutes"},"servings":"12","image":"https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PBJ-Energy-Bites-7long.jpg"}
