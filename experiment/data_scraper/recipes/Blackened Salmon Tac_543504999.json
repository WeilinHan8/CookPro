Put the mixture on a plate or other flat surface and coat the portions of salmon, 1 at a time, on the flesh side only. Heat a large heavy-bottomed pan or cast-iron skillet over medium heat, and add the oil. Add the salmon flesh side down. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes per side or until the skin is crispy. Once the salmon has slightly cooled, peel the skin away with a fork and shred into large chunks. To assemble: Char the tortillas on the stove-top (gas stoves only) until the edges are lightly burnt. Fill each tortilla with lettuce, tomato, onion, about 1/2 of each salmon fillet, a sprinkle of cilantro, a drizzle of fresh lime and a drizzle of sour-cream or salsa.","tags":[""],"time":{"prep":"10 minutes mins","cook":"10 minutes mins","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"20 minutes mins"},"servings":"8","image":"https://gimmedelicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/salmon-tacos-with-creamy-tomatillo-salsa-9-of-12.jpg"}
