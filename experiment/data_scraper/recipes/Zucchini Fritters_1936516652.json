{"name":"Zucchini Fritters","description":"These easy zucchini fritters include crispy brown edges, a tender inside, and they’re a super fun way to get your veggies in!","ingredients":["1 1/2 lbs. zucchini (2 large zucchini)","1/4 yellow onion, finely diced","1 garlic clove, minced","3/4 cup all-purpose flour","1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese","1 large egg, lightly beaten","1 tsp salt, divided","1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper","3 Tbsp cooking oil","Tzatziki Sauce"],"instructions":"Wash the zucchini well, trim off the stem, then using the large holes on a box grater, grate the zucchini. You should end up with about 4 cups of grated zucchini. Place the grated zucchini in a fine mesh cheesecloth or a strainer over a bowl. Sprinkle ½ tsp of salt over the zucchini. Give the zucchini a quick mix and let it sit for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, using the cheesecloth or clean hands, squeeze out as much liquid as you can into the bowl or over the sink. Add the grated zucchini to a large bowl along with the finely diced onion, garlic, flour, parmesan cheese, egg, ½ tsp salt, and ½ tsp freshly cracked black pepper. Mix all of the ingredients together until well combined. In a large non-stick skillet, heat the cooking oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add several spoonfuls of the zucchini mixture to the hot skillet to form small pancake-sized patties. Gently flatten the tops of each fritter with the back of a spoon or a spatula and cook each fritter until it is golden brown on both sides – about 3 minutes per side. Cook the fritters in 2 batches to keep from crowding the pan. Remove the fritters from the pan and drain on a wire rack or paper towel lined plate. Serve immediately and enjoy while they’re hot!","tags":[],"time":{"prep":"20 minutes mins","cook":"12 minutes mins","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"32 minutes mins"},"servings":"4","image":"https://www.budgetbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Zucchini-Fritters-Stack.jpg"}
