{"name":"Chocolate Peanut Butter and Jelly Cups","description":"","ingredients":[" 8 oz dark chocolate"," ¼ cup smooth peanut butter"," ¼ cup jelly or jam of choice"," Flaked or coarse salt, optional"],"instructions":"Line a mini muffin tray with 24 mini muffin liners and make space for it in the fridge. Set aside. Melt Chocolate: Break chocolate (if using a bar) into small pieces. Melt the chocolate in the microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between each interval, just until melted. Alternatively, melt over a double boiler. In a medium saucepan, bring about 1 cup of water to simmer over low heat. Place a glass bowl on top of the pot so it rests above the simmering water, but doesn't touch it! Place chocolate chips in the bowl and allow the steam to heat the bowl. Stir occasionally until the chocolate chips are melted. Once melted, turn off the heat. Drizzle 1 tsp of melted chocolate into each mini muffin case. Rotate the muffin tin around to coat the sides of the muffin liner. You can also do this with a spoon. Try to get the chocolate as high as you can get so it can form a shell around the Peanut Butter & Jelly. After you have coated all the liners, transfer the tray to the freezer for about 5 minutes to set. After the shells have hardened, add about ½ tsp of peanut butter into the middle of each case followed by about ½ teaspoon of jelly. Add about 1 tsp of the remaining melted chocolate into each liner, making sure to cover with chocolate. Sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt if desired. Return to the freeze to set for another 5-10 minutes. Enjoy immediately.","tags":[""],"time":{"prep":"25 minutes mins","cook":" ","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"25 minutes mins"},"servings":"24","image":"https://gimmedelicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/peanutbutterandjellycups-12.jpg"}
