Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.To make the rice, rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. In a small saucepan, combine the rice, water, salt, sugar, onion powder, and garlic powder. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, covered, until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Just before serving, fluff the rice with a fork and mix in the cilantro.To make the seasoned ground beef, combine the masa harina, chili powder, dried minced onion, beef bouillon powder, onion powder, garlic powder, seasoning salt, paprika, cumin, garlic salt, and sugar in a small bowl. Mix well. Crumble the ground beef into a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat until browned, stirring occasionally. Remove and discard the grease. Stir in the spice mixture and water and simmer over medium-low heat until most of the moisture has cooked away, about 20 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat before the meat is completely dry.To assemble the quesaritos, lay 4 tortillas on a clean work surface. Spread 1/4 cup of nacho cheese sauce on each tortilla to within 1 inch of the border. Add 1/4 cup of shredded cheese and top it with a second tortilla. To each cheese-filled tortilla, add a quarter of the prepared rice, seasoned ground beef, chipotle sauce, and sour cream, arranging the fillings down the center of the tortilla. Fold the sides of the tortilla inward and roll the tortilla over the filling starting from the bottom, tucking as you roll to form a tight burrito.Preheat a cast-iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Add the oil and place the rolled quesarito seam-side down. Cook for 2 minutes per side until the quesarito is browned and the cheese is melted.","tags":[],"time":{"prep":"30 minutes minutes","cook":"1 hour hour","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"1 hour hour 30 minutes minutes"},"servings":"4","image":"https://copykat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Taco-Bell-Quesarito-Photo-1.jpg"}
