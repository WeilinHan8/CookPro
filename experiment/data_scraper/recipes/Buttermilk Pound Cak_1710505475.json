{"name":"Buttermilk Pound Cake","description":"Now that I've retired from teaching, I have more time to bake. This buttermilk pound cake is the one I make most often. It is a truly southern recipe, and one I think can't be topped—once people taste it, they won't go back to their other recipes with buttermilk. —Gracie Hanchey, De Ridder, Louisiana","ingredients":["1 cup butter, softened","2-1/2 cups sugar","4 large eggs, room temperature","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","3 cups all-purpose flour","1/4 teaspoon baking soda","1 cup buttermilk","Confectioners' sugar, optional"],"instructions":"In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy, 5-7 minutes. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Combine flour and baking soda; add alternately with buttermilk and beat well. Pour into a greased and floured 10-in. fluted tube pan. Bake at 325° until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 70 minutes. Cool in pan for 15 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
