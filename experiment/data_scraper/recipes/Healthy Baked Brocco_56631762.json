{"name":"Healthy Baked Broccoli Tots","description":"Update: A reader suggested placing the whole mixture into a piping bag and pipe into a log then cut into tots or squeeze a little mixture out of the bag and cut into tots one by one.","ingredients":[" 2 cups or 12 ounces uncooked or frozen broccoli"," 1 large egg"," 1/4 cup diced yellow onion"," 1/3 cup cheddar cheese"," 1/3 cup panko breadcrumbs"," 1/3 cup italian breadcrumbs"," 2 tablespoons parsley ( or cilantro, rosemary,"," 1/2 teaspoon salt"," 1/2 teaspoon pepper"],"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Grease a baking sheet with a thin layer of oil or line with parchment paper and set aside. Blanch the broccoli in boiling water for 1 minute then remove and shock with cold tap water to stop the cooking process. Drain well. Chop broccoli finely and mix throughly with the egg, onions, cheddar, breadcrumbs, and seasoning. Scoop about 1.5 tablespoons of mix using a ice-cream scoop or your hands and gently press between your hands into a firm ball then shape into a tater-tot shape. It helps to wash your hands after every few tots to keep them from sticking onto your hands. Next, Place on your prepared baking sheet. Bake until golden brown and crispy, 18-24 minutes, turning half way. Remove from the oven and enjoy hot with ketchup, sriracha, ranch dressing, or your favorite dipping sauce!","tags":[""],"time":{"prep":"15 minutes mins","cook":"20 minutes mins","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"35 minutes mins"},"servings":"20","image":"https://gimmedelicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/broccoli-tots-22-of-29.jpg"}
