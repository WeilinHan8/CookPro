Meanwhile, slice the courgettes lengthways, then again into long matchsticks with good knife skills or using the julienne cutter on a mandolin (use the guard!).

Cook for 4 minutes, tossing regularly, while you finely slice the mint leaves, then stir them into the pan. Toss the drained pasta into the courgette pan with a splash of reserved cooking water.
