Bake for 25-30 minutes until cherries are nice and juicy. In a medium bowl mix together the ricotta, lemon juice, lemon zest and salt and pepper. Set aside. Meanwhile, preheat the grill to 400 degrees F or medium high heat. Grill each side of the crostini for approximately 2 minutes or until slightly golden brown, watching carefully so they crostini do not burn. Set aside onto a platter. Alternatively you can baked the crostini for 5 to 7 minutes at 400 degrees F in your oven. Once the crostini are cool enough to safely handle, top each one with a dollop of lemon ricotta, followed by a spoonful of roasted cherries and their juices. Finish off the crostini with a sprinkling of torn basil and a little extra lemon zest.
