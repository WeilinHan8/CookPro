This low and slow cooking method yields tender, succulent dark meat with carefully developed flavors.

Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and chill, uncovered, until skin has dried out, 8 to 12 hours. Preheat a gas grill to medium (350°F to 400°F) on one side, or push hot coals to 1 side of a charcoal grill. Place chicken thighs, skin side down, on oiled grates over lit side of the grill. Grill, covered, until skin is well marked and crispy, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn thighs over, and transfer to unlit side of grill. Grill, covered, until a thermometer registers 165°F when inserted into thickest part of a chicken thigh, 20 to 25 minutes, turning halfway through grilling. Remove from grill, and let rest 5 to 10 minutes before serving.","tags":[],"time":{"prep":"","cook":"","active":"15 mins","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"8 hrs 45 mins"},"servings":"Serves 4 (serving size: 2 thighs)","image":"https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=%5B900%2C675%5D&w=1800&h=900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F19%2F2018%2F05%2F25%2FHow_to_Grill_Everything_ChickenThighs18.jpg"}
