{"name":"Grilled Cabbage","description":"This Grilled Cabbage recipe transforms a simple, budget-friendly veggie into a charred, smokey, and down-right delicious side dish!","ingredients":["1 head cabbage (any kind!) cut into 6 wedges*","1 garlic clove, minced","3 Tbsp olive oil","1 tsp sea salt","1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper","1 tsp chili flakes","2 Tbsp grated Parmesan"],"instructions":"Peel away the outermost layers of cabbage and discard them. Cut your cabbage into 2 inch wedges and shave off the very bottom of the stem so it’s nice and clean. I like to cut the cabbage in half first, so I have a steadier base to cut from. You will want to leave the stem intact when you cut your cabbage into wedges so it stays in one piece on the grill. Whisk together the olive oil, minced garlic, sea salt, freshly cracked black pepper, chili flakes, and grated Parmesan in a small bowl. Brush the Parmesan cheese mixture over all sides of each cabbage wedge. Grill the cabbage on each side for 5-6 minutes each on a 400 degree grill. Once you put the cabbage on the grill, resist the urge to move it around. Let it sear in one spot until it’s time to flip. In my opinion, the more char, the better! Dress each grilled cabbage wedge with a drizzle of our balsamic glaze and any additional Parmesan cheese you may have, and sprinkle 1 Tbsp freshly minced parsley on top (all optional). Serve and enjoy!","tags":[],"time":{"prep":"10 minutes mins","cook":"12 minutes mins","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"22 minutes mins"},"servings":"6","image":"https://www.budgetbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grilled-Cabbage-Overhead-Close.jpg"}
