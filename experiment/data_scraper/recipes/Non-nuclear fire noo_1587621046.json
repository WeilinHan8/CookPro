What's more, you can easily adapt it to make it vegan.","ingredients":["1 tablespoon gochujang","1 tablespoon sriracha , (or your favourite fruity hot sauce)","½ tablespoon chicken bouillon powder","1 clove of garlic , grated","½ tablespoon light soy sauce","½ tablespoon golden caster (superfine) sugar","½ tablespoon toasted sesame oil","2 nests ramen noodles , (fresh or dried)","1 tablespoon neutral oil","2 boneless chicken thighs , finely sliced","2 spring onions (scallions) , finely sliced","2 egg yolks , (optional)","½ a toasted nori sheet , torn into small pieces","1 tablespoon crispy fried garlic"],"instructions":"Mix the gochujang, sriracha, chicken bouillon powder, grated garlic, light soy, sugar and sesame oil together in a jug (pitcher). Bring a pot of water to the boil and cook the noodles according to the packet instructions. Add 4 tablespoons of the noodle water to the jug, then strain the noodles and rinse with cool water, separating the noodles with your fingers, to prevent them from sticking. Set aside. Heat the oil in a non-stick, heavy-based frying pan (skillet). Add the chicken pieces and sear on all sides. Once sealed, pour in the sauce from the jug and allow it to bubble away for 2–3 minutes or until the chicken is just cooked through. Add the noodles and spring onions (scallions), tossing to coat. Divide the noodles between two bowls. Make a little dent in the middle of each and plop in an egg yolk, if using. Sprinkle with the torn nori and crispy garlic and serve immediately.","tags":["Chicken","Chicken thighs","Lunch & dinner recipes"],"time":{"prep":"","cook":"","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":""},"servings":"Serves 2","image":"https://cdn.jamieoliver.com/recipe-database/medium/153430889.jpg"}
