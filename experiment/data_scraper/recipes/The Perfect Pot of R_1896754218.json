{"name":"The Perfect Pot of Rice","description":"Want to know how to cook rice perfectly every time? All it takes is the right amount of water, a little bit of patience, no peeking—and this step-by-step guide.","ingredients":["1 cup short-grain, medium-grain, or long-grain white rice (not parboiled, converted, or quick-cooking)","½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. plus ⅛ tsp. Morton kosher salt"],"instructions":"Rinse 1 cup rice in a fine-mesh sieve until the water runs clear. (This may take up to a minute. Alternatively, you can rinse rice in a bowl or pot with several changes of cold water, draining carefully between rinses, but we think the strainer method is the least annoying.) Combine rice, ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. plus ⅛ tsp. Morton kosher salt, and 1¼ cups cold water in a medium saucepan. Give everything a gentle stir. Bring to a boil, then cover pot with a tight-fitting lid and reduce heat to low, aiming for the lowest possible flame. Cook rice over low heat, undisturbed—that means not opening the lid!—for 18 minutes. Remove pan from heat. Let stand at least 15 minutes or until ready to use. Uncover and fluff cooked rice with a fork before serving. Editor’s note: This stovetop rice recipe was first printed in our June 2012 issue.
