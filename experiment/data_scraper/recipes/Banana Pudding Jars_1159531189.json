{"name":"Banana Pudding Jars","description":"Stacked with chopped bananas, vanilla pudding, and crunchy Marie biscuits, these individual banana pudding jars are the perfect make-ahead summer dessert.","ingredients":["1 Tbsp. dark brown sugar","1 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice","2 tsp. vanilla extract","½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt","5 medium ripe bananas, peeled","1 3.4-oz. box instant vanilla pudding and pie filling","2 cups whole milk","1 8-oz. package cream cheese, room temperature, divided","1 7-oz. package Marie biscuits (such as Britannia)"," Whipped cream (for serving)"," Eight 6-oz. (or larger) glass jars with lids"],"instructions":"Stir together 1 Tbsp. dark brown sugar, 1 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice, 2 tsp. vanilla extract, and ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a medium bowl until sugar and salt are dissolved. Cut 5 medium ripe bananas, peeled, lengthwise into quarters, then cut into ¼\"-thick pieces. Add to bowl and gently toss to coat (make sure all of the pieces get coated to prevent excess browning). Set banana mixture aside. Beat one 3.4-oz. box instant vanilla pudding and pie filling and 2 cups whole milk in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on medium speed until well combined, about 3 minutes. With motor running, add one 8-oz. package cream cheese, room temperature, about 2 oz. at a time, mixing until incorporated before adding more; beat until smooth, about 4 minutes total. Scrape pudding into a large piping bag without a tip. (Or, scrape into a large resealable plastic bag and snip off a corner.) Line up jars on counter. Working one at a time, spoon about 1 Tbsp. reserved banana mixture into each. Pipe a thin layer of pudding over, then top with 1 whole biscuit from one 7-oz. package Marie biscuits. (If jar is too small to fit a whole cookie, break into 2 or 3 pieces and layer in.) Repeat layering process, starting with banana mixture followed by pudding and biscuit and ending with a final layer of pudding, until pudding is used up. Crush any leftover biscuits and set aside for serving. Cover jars with lids and chill at least 2 hours. When ready to serve, uncover and top each pudding jar with whipped cream and reserved biscuits. Do Ahead: Pudding jars can be assembled 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.","tags":["fruit dessert","pudding","nut-free","make ahead","banana","cream cheese"],"time":{"prep":"","cook":"","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":""},"servings":"","image":"https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/667ae9c42b1e411f1774c193/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/BA_0824_SAM_FORE_SHOT_03_284.jpg"}
