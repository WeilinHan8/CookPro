{"name":"Smash burgers","description":"The new method of ‘smashing’ burgers creates the ultimate meaty crust. Serve in a burger bun with lettuce, gherkin, tomatoes and your favourite sauces","ingredients":["4 burger buns, sesame topped or brioche, whichever you prefer ","1 tbsp sunflower oil","500g steak mince, 15-20% fat is good ","4 slices mild cheddar, or burger cheese","1 red onion, finely sliced","handfuls of iceberg lettuce, finely shredded","2 tomatoes, sliced ","1 large gherkin, sliced lengthways","mayonnaise, ketchup and American mustard, or your preferred sauces, to serve "],"instructions":"Slice the burger buns in half, then toast or grill the cut sides and set aside. Heat the oven to 100C/80C fan/gas ¼. Divide the mince into four loose piles and season generously with salt. Heat ¼ tbsp oil in a heavy frying pan or skillet over a high heat and put one of the piles in the pan. Working quickly, cover with a square of baking parchment and use a second smaller pan to press the beef patty down as hard as you can (you may wear oven gloves or use the end of a rolling pin for pressing down, being careful of the heat and rising steam). Allow to cook for 2 mins. Remove the parchment and turn the patty over. Press down with a spatula, cover with a slice of cheese and cook for 1 min. Transfer to a baking tray and keep warm in the oven while you cook the other burgers in the same way. To assemble the burger, scatter a bun base with onion, lettuce and tomato slices, followed by a smashed patty, gherkin slices and the bun top. Serve with your chosen sauces on the side.","tags":[],"time":{"prep":"10 mins","cook":"15 mins","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":""},"servings":"","image":"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2022/12/Smash-burger-26abeae.jpg?resize=900%2C471"}
