{"name":"Berry meringue ripple","description":"A fruity dessert recipe from Jamie Oliver. This is like a super-quick twist on the classic Eton mess recipe, but with the addition of vanilla ice cream.","ingredients":["2 large scoops of vanilla ice cream","200 g blueberries","2 shop-bought meringues","100 g raspberries","dark chocolate , (70%), to serve"],"instructions":"Get your ice cream out of the freezer. Put the blueberries into a non-stick frying pan with a splash of water and place on a high heat for 2 minutes, or until they all start to burst and get jammy, then remove from the heat. Layering up as you like, crumble the meringues between glasses or bowls, halve and add the raspberries and a nice round scoop of ice cream to each, then spoon over the jammy blueberries and their juices. Shave or grate over a little chocolate and tuck in, rippling it all together in a wonderful collision of flavours.","tags":["Romantic meals","British","Fruit","Desserts","Puddings & desserts"],"time":{"prep":"","cook":"Time 8 minutes","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"Time 8 minutes"},"servings":"Serves 2","image":"https://cdn.jamieoliver.com/recipe-database/medium/89080980.jpg"}
