In a large mixing bowl or mixer, combine sugar, flour, baking powder and salt. In a separate bowl, beat egg, milk and oil. Gradually add dry mixture to wet until just moist. Fold in blueberries. (Optional: coat them in flour first, to help prevent sinking to the bottom of the pan.) Pour batter into pan (up to 1½ inches below the top) compensating for rise. Optional: sprinkle sugar on top just before baking if you're not topping with glaze. Bake 50-60 minutes. Allow to cool on wire rack 10-15 minutes before removing from loaf pan. If you're adding a glaze, mix all glaze ingredients together in a small bowl while the bread cools. Add glaze after loaf is cooled.
