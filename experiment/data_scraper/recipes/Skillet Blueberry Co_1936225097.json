Toss 10 oz. fresh or frozen blueberries (about 2 cups blueberries), 3 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice, 2 tsp. (8 g) sugar, and a pinch of kosher salt in a medium bowl to combine, then, using your hands, coarsely crush berries. Let sit, stirring occasionally, until ready to use. Whisk 1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour, 1½ tsp. baking powder, remaining ⅔ cup (133 g) sugar, and remaining 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a medium bowl to combine; stir in ½ cup whole milk into dry ingredients (batter will be thick). Melt ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter in a 10\" cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Remove pan from heat; scrape in batter. Spread into an even layer as much as possible (the butter will ooze over batter and pool at the sides). Spoon blueberry mixture, including any juices, over batter. Bake cobbler in oven until cake is golden brown and berries are juicy, 45–50 minutes. Serve warm topped with scoops of vanilla ice cream.
