{"name":"Cucumber-Lime Sports Drink","description":"Loosely based on the WHO’s rehydration formula, this DIY electrolyte drink with cucumber, lime, and mint is the perfect salve for hot summer days.","ingredients":["1 cup fresh lime juice (from about 8 medium limes)","1 Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. sugar","½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt","1 large English hothouse cucumber (about 11 oz.)","1 cup coarsely chopped mint; plus sprigs for serving (optional)"],"instructions":"Combine 1 cup fresh lime juice (from about 8 medium limes), 1 Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. sugar, ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt, and 3¼ cups water in a medium bowl and stir until sugar and salt are dissolved. Cut 1 large English hothouse cucumber (about 11 oz.) crosswise into 4 equal pieces. Set 1 quarter aside for serving. Place 1 cup coarsely chopped mint on top of remaining cucumber and smash with a rolling pin until mint is slightly wilted and cucumber is broken up into large pieces. (Alternatively, you can smash together in a large bowl with your hands.) Scrape mint and cucumber into lime juice mixture and let sit 10 minutes. Strain drink into a large pitcher, pressing on mint and cucumber to extract all of their juices; discard solids. Thinly slice reserved cucumber into rounds. Serve drink in ice-filled glasses garnished with sliced cucumber and mint sprigs. (Or, you can pour into a water bottle to take on the go and skip the garnishes.) Do Ahead: Drink (without cucumber slices and mint sprigs) can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.","tags":["cold drink","5 ingredients or fewer","dairy-free","cucumber","mint","quick","30 minutes or less"],"time":{"prep":"","cook":"","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":""},"servings":"","image":"https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/667ae70a2b1e411f1774c191/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/BA0824-DIY-Electrolytes-RECIPE_V1_050124_0836_VOG_final.jpg"}
