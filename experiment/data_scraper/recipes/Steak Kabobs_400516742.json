{"name":"Steak Kabobs","description":"My steak kabobs are bold and zesty, stacking tender steak and veggies in each bite. This 4 ingredient steak kabob marinade is a family fave!","ingredients":["½ cup balsamic vinegar","½ cup extra virgin olive oil","2 tablespoons minced garlic","fresh cracked pepper to taste","1½ pounds sirloin steak or similar, cubed in one inch pieces","1 red onion cut into 1-inch pieces","1 yellow bell pepper cut into 1-inch pieces","1 green pepper cut into 1-inch pieces","1 red pepper cut into 1-inch pieces","12 ounces fresh mushrooms halved or whole"],"instructions":"In a rectangular dish (or medium mixing bowl), whisk together the oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic and fresh cracked pepper. Place the steak in the bowl with the marinade (or in a large Ziplock bag). Marinate 1+ hour, up to 4-6 hours refrigerated, covered. Assemble kabobs by carefully threading the marinated steak and veggies, alternating along the bamboo skewer. Leave a little space between ingredients to allow them to cook evenly on the grill. (I like to brush the assembled kabobs with remaining marinade right back in my baking dish, before discarding the marinade when I place them on the grill.) Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Brush olive oil onto the grate. Add steak kabobs to grill. For steak prepared medium (140°–145°F), grill 2 minutes per side for a total of 8 minutes.","tags":[],"time":{"prep":"10 minutes mins","cook":"8 minutes mins","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"18 minutes mins"},"servings":"4","image":"https://julieblanner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/steak-kabobs-9.jpg"}
