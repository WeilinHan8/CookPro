{"name":"Ridiculously Good Air Fryer Salmon","description":"This air fryer salmon is TOO GOOD. Crisped and golden on the outside, buttery and juicy on the inside, and made in 15 minutes.","ingredients":["1 lb. salmon (see note 1)","1 tablespoon brown sugar","1 teaspoon paprika","1 teaspoon smoked paprika","1/2 teaspoon chili powder","1 teaspoon onion powder","1/2 teaspoon garlic powder","1 teaspoon cornstarch","3/4 teaspoon coarse kosher salt (or 1/2 teaspoon table salt)","2–3 teaspoons avocado or olive oil"],"instructions":"Prep the salmon: Remove the skin from your salmon, if it has skin. Pat with paper towels so the surface is mostly dry. Cut your salmon into cubes, 1 to 2 inches each (see photo). Prep the spices: Mix the spices together in a small bowl. Toss salmon with spices: Toss your salmon cubes in the spices and oil – I usually use my hands to mix it all together. Air fry the salmon: Place your salmon pieces in the air fryer (I just dump them right in) and spread them out a bit so they’re not laying all over each other. Air fry at 400 degrees for 8 minutes! You’re Done! Yum! At this point it should be textured and golden on the outside, and juicy and delicious on the inside. When you press each piece with a fork, they should easily flake / slip apart with a buttery, juicy texture inside. (You can do 6-7 minutes if you prefer more of a medium doneness.)","tags":["Air Fryer","Recipes","All Recipes","Dairy-Free","Dinner","Fish and Seafood","Gluten-Free","Healthy","Most Popular","Quick and Easy","Salmon"],"time":{"prep":"5 minutes","cook":"8 minutes","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"13 minutes"},"servings":"4 servings","image":"https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Air-Fryer-Salmon-2.jpg"}
