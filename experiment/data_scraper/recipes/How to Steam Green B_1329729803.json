{"name":"How to Steam Green Beans","description":"Learn how to steam fresh green beans for an easy, delicious, fresh, and versatile side dish that will go with just about any dinner.","ingredients":["1 lb. fresh green beans","1 Tbsp butter","1/4 tsp salt","1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper"],"instructions":"Rinse the green beans in a colander. Snap the end off of any beans that still have an attached stem (see photos below). Snap each bean in half, or leave the beans whole for a more dramatic presentation.  Place one inch of water in a pot or deep skillet. Place the steam basket inside the pot. The water should not be so deep that it comes up through the holes in the steam basket. Fill the steam basket with the washed green beans. Place a lid on the pot or skillet, turn the heat onto high, and allow the water to come to a boil (about 3 minutes). Allow the green beans to steam for about 5 minutes from the time the water begins to boil, or until they have reached your desired level of tenderness. Aim for green beans that are vibrant in color and tender but not mushy. You can test the tenderness of the green beans with a fork. Once cooked to your liking, remove the pot from the heat. Remove the steam basket with the green beans and discard the water from the bottom of the pot. Place the beans back in the pot without the steam basket and add some butter. Stir the butter into the green beans, allowing the residual heat to melt the butter. Season the beans with salt and pepper, then serve.","tags":[],"time":{"prep":"5 minutes mins","cook":"8 minutes mins","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"13 minutes mins"},"servings":"4","image":"https://www.budgetbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/How-to-Steam-Green-Beans-H.jpg"}
