{"name":"Honey Chipotle Chicken Skewers","description":"Chicken skewers that are very easy, deliciously smoky, nice and sweet, with lots of spice and bite. Air fryer, grill, and oven-friendly!","ingredients":["1 pound chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces","wood skewers (optional)","1 1/2 tablespoon honey","1 chipotle pepper in adobo, minced","1 clove garlic, grated","2 tablespoons taco seasoning (I like the Siete brand)","1 orange, zest and juice (1–2 teaspoons zest and 1 tablespoon juice)","1/2 teaspoon kosher salt","1 tablespoon avocado oil"],"instructions":"Soak: Soak the skewers in water for 15-30 minutes while you prep the chicken. Mix: Using your hands or tongs, mix the chicken with the honey chipotle mix. It’ll look saucy and messy, in a good way. Skewers: Thread the chicken pieces onto skewers (usually I get 4 skewers with a pound of chicken). Cook Em Up: You can cook these a number of different ways – I air fry them at 400 degrees for 10 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees. Grilling would also be amazing! Finish with a drizzle of honey, or (yum) 2 tablespoons of melted butter mixed with honey. It’s so good!","tags":["Air Fryer","Recipes","All Recipes","Dairy-Free","Dinner","Gluten-Free","Healthy","Main Dishes","Meat and Chicken","Quick and Easy"],"time":{"prep":"10 minutes","cook":"10 minutes","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"20 minutes"},"servings":"3–4 servings","image":"https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Honey-Chipotle-Chicken-Skewers.jpg"}
