{"name":"Amazing Green Rice","description":"This green rice is my FAVORITE! It's packed with spinach and cilantro, perfectly spicy, nutritious, and goes with just about everything.","ingredients":["1 1/2 cups long-grain white rice","1 bunch cilantro (about 1 cup packed)","3–4 cups fresh spinach","1 shallot, peeled and roughly chopped","1 serrano pepper, ribs and seeds removed, roughly chopped (sub a jalapeño pepper)","1–2 cloves garlic","2 tablespoons olive oil","1/2 teaspoon salt (1 teaspoon salt if using water)","2 cups chicken or vegetable broth, or water (up to 2 1/2 cups for stickier rice)"],"instructions":"Rice Prep: Thoroughly rinse the rise in a mesh colander. Shake it a few times to remove excess water, or blot it dry with paper towels. (This prevents it from splattering in the oil when you add it to the pan in Step 3.) Make Green Herb Mixture: Pulse the cilantro, spinach, shallot, serrano, and garlic in a food processor until very finely chopped. Saute the Rice: Add olive oil to a skillet over medium high heat. Add rice and sauté for 3-5 minutes until lightly toasted. Add the herb mixture and salt; sauté for another 3-5 minutes until nice and fragrant.  Cook the Rice: Add the broth or water, bring to a simmer. Cover and keep over low heat for 15-ish minutes. Check the rice by fluffing with a fork; add more water / cook longer if necessary. When the rice is done to your liking, remove from heat and fluff with a fork to distribute the greens. You’re Done! Yum! Serve with chicken skewers, air fryer chicken or salmon, tacos, beans and creamy corn, etc. ","tags":["All Recipes","Recipes","Dairy-Free","Gluten-Free","Jalapeño","Rice","Spinach","Stovetop","Vegan","Vegetarian"],"time":{"prep":"15 minutes","cook":"15 minutes","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"30 minutes"},"servings":"6 servings","image":"https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Rice-in-a-Pan.jpg"}
