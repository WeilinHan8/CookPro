Perfect for quick dinners and meal prep!","ingredients":["2 tsp steak seasoning","1/2 tsp smoked paprika","1/2 tsp sweet paprika","2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (1.3 lbs. total)","1 Tbsp cooking oil","1 Tbsp butter (optional)"],"instructions":"Combine the steak seasoning, smoked paprika, and sweet paprika in a bowl. Coat the chicken breasts liberally with the seasoning on all sides. Add the cooking oil to a large skillet and heat over medium-low (or medium for thin-cut breasts). Once hot, swirl the oil to coat the skillet. Add the chicken breasts to the skillet and cook for about 8 minutes without flipping (5 minutes for thin-cut breasts). Flip the chicken and then cook on the second side until well browned and cooked through (internal temperature of 165ÂºF). For extra luscious chicken, add a tablespoon of butter to the skillet, allow it to melt, then flip the chicken a couple of times to coat in the melted butter. Transfer the chicken to a clean cutting board and allow it to rest for five minutes before slicing and serving.","tags":[],"time":{"prep":"5 minutes mins","cook":"15 minutes mins","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"20 minutes mins"},"servings":"4","image":"https://www.budgetbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Chicken-Breast-Pan.jpg"}
