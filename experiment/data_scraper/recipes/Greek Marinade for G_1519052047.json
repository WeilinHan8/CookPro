{"name":"Greek Marinade for Grilled Chicken","description":"Simple Greek marinade made with olive oil, garlic, oregano, thyme, lemon juice and red wine vinegar. Perfect for grilling chicken breast or souvlaki.","ingredients":["4 boneless skinless chicken breasts","1/3 cup olive oil","1/4 cup red wine vinegar","2 tbsp lemon juice","4 garlic cloves, minced","1 tbsp oregano","2 tsp thyme","1 tsp salt","1 tsp ground black pepper"],"instructions":"Mix all the ingredients, minus the chicken breast in a mason jar or a bowl.  Place the chicken breasts in a dish and pour the marinade over them, turning them in the marinade to ensure that they are completely coated. Cover the dish with a lid or plastic wrap and place in the fridge for at least an hour. Preheat grill to medium high heat, around 450F. Place the chicken on a hot grill and close the lid. After the chicken has cooked for about 5 minutes, lift the lid and turn the chicken breasts over. Close the lid and let the chicken cook some more. The chicken is finished cooking when the meat has an internal temperature of 165F, when checked with a digital thermometer. Grilling boneless skinless chicken breast takes about 12-15 minutes, but can vary depending on the size and thickness of the meat.  Remove from the grill and let the chicken breast rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the juices to draw back into the centre of the meat. Serve with tzatziki, greek salad, and rice.","tags":[],"time":{"prep":"10 minutes minutes","cook":"15 minutes minutes","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"30 minutes minutes"},"servings":"4","image":"https://www.theblackpeppercorn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Greek-Marinade-for-Grilled-Chicken-2-2.jpg"}
