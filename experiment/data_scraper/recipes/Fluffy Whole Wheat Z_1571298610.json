{"name":"Fluffy Whole Wheat Zucchini Bread Pancakes","description":"Whole wheat zucchini bread pancakes with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. These healthy zucchini pancakes taste like a slice of zucchini bread!","ingredients":["For the dry ingredients:","1 cup whole wheat pastry flour or white whole wheat flour*","2 teaspoons baking powder","1 ¼ teaspoons cinnamon","¼ teaspoon nutmeg","¼ teaspoon salt","For the wet ingredients:","1 heaping cup shredded zucchini, squeezed of excess moisture with a paper towel (from 1 medium zucchini)","1 egg","2 tablespoons pure maple syrup (or honey)","1 tablespoon melted and cooled coconut oil (or sub melted butter)","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","½ cup unsweetened vanilla almond milk (or milk of choice)","Optional: ¼ cup chopped pecans"],"instructions":"In a large bowl, whisk together whole wheat pastry flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. In a separate large bowl, combine shredded zucchini, egg, maple syrup, coconut oil, vanilla and almond milk until smooth and well combined. Fold in pecans if using. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients and mix until just combined. If the batter looks too thick add just a splash more milk. If it’s way to wet, add another tablespoon of flour. Lightly coat a large nonstick skillet or griddle with coconut oil or butter and place over medium heat. Drop batter by 1/3 cup onto skillet and spread out a bit with a spoon if necessary. Cook until bubbles appear on top, about 2 minutes. Flip cakes and cook until golden brown on underside, 2 minutes. Wipe skillet clean and repeat with more coconut oil (or butter) and remaining batter. You may need to reduce the heat after the second batch to prevent burning. Serves 4, 2 pancakes each.","tags":[],"time":{"prep":"10 minutes minutes","cook":"10 minutes minutes","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"20 minutes minutes"},"servings":"4","image":"https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pancakes-FB.png"}
