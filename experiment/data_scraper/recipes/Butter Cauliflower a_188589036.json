{"name":"Butter Cauliflower and Chickpeas with Mint Cilantro Sauce","description":"This Butter Cauliflower is a weeknight staple! Roasty cauliflower, a jar of butter sauce, canned chickpeas, and mint sauce all over top.","ingredients":["1–2 tablespoons avocado oil","1 head cauliflower, cut into florets (about 3 cups)","1 teaspoon each cumin, garam masala, and curry powder","1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika","1/2 teaspoon kosher salt","1 can chickpeas, drained and rinsed","1 jar of butter chicken sauce (24.5 ounces) or homemade","1/4 cup packed mint leaves","1/4 cup packed cilantro","1/2 cup mayo or plain Greek yogurt","1 clove garlic","1 small chunk of jalapeño, optional","1/2 teaspoon salt","juice of 1 lime"],"instructions":"Roast the cauliflower: Toss the cauliflower with the avocado oil, cumin, garam masala, curry powder, smoked paprika, and salt. Roast at 425 / 20 minutes in the air fryer, or 425 / 30 minutes in the oven until nice and roasty and golden. Make the mint sauce: Blitz everything up until it’s nice and smooth. I like to really blend this one so it’s less chunky and more of a smooth green sauce. Butter sauce time: Add butter sauce and chickpeas to a large skillet. Smash the chickpeas lightly with a potato masher to give a more interesting texture if you want (I do want). Add cauliflower back in.  Serve: Serve the butter cauliflower on rice and top with the mint sauce. Add pickled onions if you want. ENJOY!","tags":["All Recipes","Recipes","Cauliflower","Dinner","Gluten-Free","Quick and Easy","Rice","Stovetop","Vegetarian","Winter"],"time":{"prep":"10 minutes","cook":"30 minutes","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"40 minutes"},"servings":"6","image":"https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Butter-Cauliflower-and-Chickpeas-1.jpg"}
