{"name":"Sticky teriyaki aubergine","description":"Fresh chilli, crunchy peanuts and spring onion really take this veggie aubergine dish to the next level. Just 5 ingredients and on the table in 20 minutes. ","ingredients":["1 large aubergine , (400g)","4 spring onions","1 fresh red or yellow chilli","20 g unsalted peanuts","2 tablespoons teriyaki sauce"],"instructions":"Put a 26cm non-stick frying pan on a high heat and pour in 250ml of water. Halve the aubergine lengthways, quickly slash the flesh side of each half a few times and place skin side up in the pan, then season with sea salt and black pepper. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, or until it boils dry and begins to sizzle (listen for the change in sound). Meanwhile, trim the spring onions. Cut the whites into 3cm lengths at an angle and put aside. Deseed the chilli and finely slice lengthways with the green part of the spring onions. Place both in a bowl of ice-cold water and put aside to crisp up. When the aubergine starts to sizzle, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil, the white spring onion and the peanuts to the pan, stirring regularly. After 2 minutes, add a splash of water, drizzle in the teriyaki and reduce to a medium heat. Turn the aubergine, jiggle the pan and let it get sticky for a few minutes, then dish up, sprinkled with the drained green spring onion and chilli.","tags":["Vegetables","Romantic meals","Dinner for two","Cheap & cheerful"],"time":{"prep":"","cook":"Time 20 minutes","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"Time 20 minutes"},"servings":"Serves 2","image":"https://cdn.jamieoliver.com/recipe-database/medium/108100221.jpg"}
