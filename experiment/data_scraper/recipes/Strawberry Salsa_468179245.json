{"name":"Strawberry Salsa","description":"This strawberry salsa recipe is delicious, colorful and easy to make! It's the perfect spring or summer party appetizer. Serve with chips or on crostini!","ingredients":["Juice and zest from 1 medium lime","1 ½ teaspoons honey or maple syrup","Pinch of fine sea salt","1 pint of strawberries, hulled and diced","1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and chopped (use a smaller jalapeño for less heat, or leave in some seeds for more heat)","½ small red onion, chopped","½ cup chopped fresh cilantro","Freshly ground black pepper, to taste","Chips for serving"],"instructions":"In a large bowl, whisk together the lime juice and zest, honey and salt. Stir in the strawberries, jalapeño, onion and cilantro. Add pepper, to taste, and mix well. Adjust the seasonings if need be (you might like a little more lime for acidity, honey for sweetness, or salt if it’s just not quite right yet). If your strawberries are nice and juicy, you can serve immediately, with chips. My salsa needed some time to marinate before it was juicy and awesome (about 30 minutes should do it). Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.","tags":["appetizers","condiments, dips & sauces","dairy free","egg free","gluten free","Independence Day","Mexican","naturally sweetened","nut free","recipes","snacks","soy free","spring","summer","tomato free","vegan"],"time":{"prep":"10 mins","cook":"","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"10 minutes"},"servings":"4 servings","image":"https://cookieandkate.com/images/2017/03/strawberry-salsa-recipe.jpg"}
