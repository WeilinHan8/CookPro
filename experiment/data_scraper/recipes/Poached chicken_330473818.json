{"name":"Poached chicken","description":"Get gorgeously tender poached chicken with this super-easy recipe that's dairy-free and gluten-free. Plus you make an epic chicken stock to use for amazing gravy another day!","ingredients":["2 large onions","1-2 leeks","4 celery stalks","4 carrots","1 bulb of garlic","1 x 1.7 kg free-range chicken","3-4 fresh bay leaves","3 sprigs of fresh tarragon","1 large bunch of fresh parsley (or just stalks if youâ€™re using leaves for something else)","1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns"],"instructions":"Peel and halve the onions, then chop the leeks, celery and carrots into large chunks. Halve the garlic bulb around the equator. Put all the ingredients in a large pan with a pinch of sea salt, then cover with cold water. Place on the hob over a medium heat and bring just to the boil. Reduce the heat to a low simmer, skimming off any scum that rises to the top. Simmer gently for about 1 hour, or until the juices run clear when you pierce the meat. Remove the bird from the pan and bubble the poaching liquid for 40 minutes, or until reduced by about one-third (to add more flavour, you could strip the meat from the chicken and return the bones to the stock, too). Sieve the stock, then store in the fridge for up to 1 week.","tags":["Jamie Magazine","Chicken","Kosher for Passover","One-pan recipes"],"time":{"prep":"","cook":"Time 1 hour 55 minutes","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"Time 1 hour 55 minutes"},"servings":"Serves 6","image":"https://cdn.jamieoliver.com/recipe-database/medium/2Tm-PNMLa3RBevgZGeqUGM.jpg"}
