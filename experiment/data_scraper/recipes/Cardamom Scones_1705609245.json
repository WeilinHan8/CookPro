{"name":"Cardamom Scones","description":"These delicious cinnamon cardamom scones are easy to make, perfectly soft and flaky, and drizzled with a simple glaze. New favorite scone alert! ♡ My mom recently brought us a batch of freshly-baked cinnamon scones,","ingredients":["1 3/4 cups (230 g) all-purpose flour","1/3 cup granulated white sugar, divided","1 tablespoon baking powder","1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt","1/2 cup (8 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, diced","1/3 cup half and half","1 large egg + 1 egg white","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","2 teaspoons ground cardamom","2 teaspoons ground cinnamon","1/2 cup powdered sugar","1 tablespoon half and half"],"instructions":"Prep the oven and baking sheet. Heat the oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Make the dough. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, baking powder and salt until evenly combined. Use a pastry cutter (or your fingers) to cut the butter into the dough until it resembles coarse cornmeal. Create a well in the center of the bowl, add the half and half, 1 egg and vanilla extract. Then use a fork to briefly whisk the wet ingredients together. Whisk the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until a dough begins to form. Use your hands to bring the dough together and knead the dough a few times until a ball can be formed. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Make the cardamom-cinnamon-sugar. In a separate bowl, whisk the cardamom, cinnamon and 2 tablespoons sugar together until combined. Layer the scones. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into a roughly 8×11-inch rectangle (the size of a sheet of paper). Sprinkle half of the cinnamon-sugar mixture over the dough and lightly press it down with your hands (see video), then fold the dough in half. Use the rolling pin to roll the dough out lightly into an 6×10-inch rectangle. Sprinkle the remaining cinnamon-sugar over the dough, then fold in half once more. Use your hands to lightly press down the dough to seal the edges, then shape the dough roughly into a 6-inch circle. Use a sharp knife to slice the dough into 6 pie wedges and transfer them to the prepared baking sheet. Top the scones. Whisk the egg white together with 1 tablespoon of water until lightly frothy. Brush the egg wash evenly over the tops of the scones to coat, then sprinkle the remaining sugar on top. Bake. Bake for 15 minutes or until the scones are slightly golden around the edges. Transfer to a wire baking rack to cool. Make the glaze. Meanwhile, whisk together the glaze ingredients until combined. (If it seems too thick, add in more liquid. If it’s too thin, add in more powdered sugar.) Once the scones have cooled to room temperature, drizzle them with the glaze. Serve. Serve immediately and enjoy!","tags":["American-Inspired","Baked Goods / Breads"],"time":{"prep":"20 mins","cook":"15 mins","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"35 mins"},"servings":"6 scones","image":"https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cardamom-Scones-12.jpg"}
