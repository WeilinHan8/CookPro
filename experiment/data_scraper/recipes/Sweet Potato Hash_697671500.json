{"name":"Sweet Potato Hash","description":"This easy, one-skillet Sweet Potato Hash is the perfect balance of sweet and savory flavors. It's great for breakfast, lunch or dinner!","ingredients":["1.5 lbs. sweet potatoes (about 2 medium)","1 yellow onion","1 red bell pepper","8 oz. breakfast sausage","1/2 Tbsp cooking oil","3/4 tsp salt","1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper","1/2 tsp garlic powder","1/2 tsp smoked paprika"],"instructions":"Wash, peel, and dice the sweet potatoes. Dice the onion and the red bell pepper. Set the vegetables to the side. In a large non-stick skillet, crumble the breakfast sausage and cook over medium heat. Cook the sausage until it’s almost completely browned. Add the diced onion and continue cooking until the onion is translucent and the sausage is fully browned. Remove the sausage and onions to a separate plate and set it to the side. In the same skillet, add the cooking oil and the diced sweet potatoes. Cook the sweet potatoes over medium heat for 10-12 minutes. Stir occasionally but not too often so the sweet potatoes have a chance to brown and caramelize. Don’t worry if the sweet potatoes are not fork tender during this time as they will continue to cook in the next step. Now add the diced red bell pepper, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and smoked paprika to the skillet. Stir together with the sweet potatoes. Cook for an additional 3-5 minutes or until the sweet potatoes are now fork tender. Add the cooked sausage and onions back to the skillet and combine with the sweet potatoes and peppers. Cook for 1-2 more minutes to allow the sausage to reheat with the rest of the hash. Serve this sweet potato hash with fresh parsley, sliced avocado, or any of your favorite toppings!","tags":[],"time":{"prep":"10 minutes mins","cook":"27 minutes mins","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"37 minutes mins"},"servings":"6","image":"https://www.budgetbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sweet-Potato-Hash-Overhead.jpg"}
