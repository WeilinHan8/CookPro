Made in five minutes and delicious as ever!","ingredients":["1/2 cup mayo (vegan or regular)","1–2 tablespoons gochujang sauce (I use a sauce like this)","1 clove grated garlic","1 teaspoon soy sauce","1 teaspoon rice vinegar","salt and pepper to taste"],"instructions":"Mix all ingredients together in a small bowl. Taste and adjust! I usually add a small pinch of salt because I love salt. You can also thin it out with a tablespoon of water so more of a drizzle if that’s what you’re going for! Serve as a dip with grilled or air-fried chicken, a dressing for a creamy slaw, a spread on a burger – whatever floats your boat. It’s all so delicious.","tags":["5 Ingredients","Recipes","All Recipes","Dairy-Free","Quick and Easy","Sauces"],"time":{"prep":"5 minutes","cook":"0 minutes","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"5 minutes"},"servings":"6 servings","image":"https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Gochujang-Sauce-1.jpg"}
