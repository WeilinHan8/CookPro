Sear the cooked chicken thighs skin-down in a nonstick pan, no need to add oil, for 3- minutes or until the skin is crispy.)","tags":[""],"time":{"prep":"10 minutes mins","cook":"30 minutes mins","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"40 minutes mins"},"servings":"4","image":"https://gimmedelicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/One-Pan-Chicken-and-Rice-with-Sun-dried-tomato-Parmesan-and-Basil3.jpg"}
