{"name":"12-minute spaghettini","description":"You can’t get much quicker and easier than this beautifully simple, healthy pasta recipe – sweet, ripe tomatoes, a hum of garlic, salty olives and a hit of freshness from the basil. ","ingredients":["2 cloves of garlic","250 g mixed-colour ripe cherry tomatoes","1 handful of black olives , (stone in)","olive oil","½ a bunch of fresh basil , (15g)","160 g dried spaghettini or taglierini","20 g salted ricotta or feta cheese"],"instructions":"Place a pan of salted water on a high heat and bring to the boil. Peel and finely slice 2 cloves of garlic, halve 250g of mixed-colour ripe cherry tomatoes, destone 1 handful of black olives and pick the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh basil (15g). Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil into a large frying pan over a high heat, add the garlic and fry for 1 minute, then throw in the tomatoes and fry gently for 1 further minute, or until they are starting to break down a little. Tear in the olives and basil, saving the baby leaves to garnish, then add a splash of water, turn the heat down a little and continue to simmer gently until needed. Cook 160g of dried spaghettini or taglierini in the pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions, then drain, reserving a mugful of cooking water. Tip the pasta back into the pan, with the sauce and toss together, loosening with a splash of cooking water, if needed. Season to taste with sea salt and black pepper, then scatter with 20g of finely grated salted ricotta or a crumbling of feta and the reserved basil leaves.","tags":["Dinner for two","Italian","Fruit","Tomato","Feta","Mains"],"time":{"prep":"","cook":"Time 12 minutes","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"Time 12 minutes"},"servings":"Serves 2","image":"https://cdn.jamieoliver.com/recipe-database/medium/134764390.jpg"}
