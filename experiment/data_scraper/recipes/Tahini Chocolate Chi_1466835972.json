These eggless, healthy cookie dough bites are vegan, dairy free & gluten free!","ingredients":["½ cup (115g) drippy tahini","2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted and cooled","4 tablespoons pure maple syrup","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","½ cup (56g) packed fine blanched almond flour","2-3 tablespoons coconut flour (start with 2)","¼ teaspoon salt","3 tablespoons chocolate chips","For the dark chocolate coating:","1 (3 ounce) 70% dark chocolate bar","1 teaspoon coconut oil"],"instructions":"In a medium bowl, mix tahini and coconut oil together until smooth. Next stir in maple syrup and vanilla extract until well combined. Add in almond flour, 2 tablespoons coconut flour and salt and stir until a cookie dough consistency forms. Allow dough to sit for 5 minutes so that it thickens up. It should be doughy and moist but not overly wet; if it’s too wet add another ½ tablespoon of coconut flour. Stir in chocolate chips. Grab about a tablespoonful of dough and roll into a ball and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. You should get about 10 cookie dough balls. Freeze for 10-15 minutes. While the cookie dough is freezing, break chocolate up into chunks and place into a microwave safe bowl with coconut oil. Microwave on high in 30 second intervals until chocolate is melted and smooth. Alternatively you can melt in a small saucepan over low heat. Use a fork to dip each cookie dough ball into melted chocolate and stir to fully coat, then place cookie dough ball back on the baking sheet. You likely will not use all of the chocolate. Freeze again for 10 minutes, then take back out of the freezer and use a spoon to drizzle the cookie dough balls with remaining melted chocolate for a pretty look on top. Place back in freeze for 5 minutes, then enjoy! Makes 10.","tags":[],"time":{"prep":"15 minutes minutes","cook":"25 minutes minutes","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"40 minutes minutes"},"servings":"10","image":"https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Tahini-Chocolate-Chip-Cookie-Dough-Bites-5long.jpg"}
