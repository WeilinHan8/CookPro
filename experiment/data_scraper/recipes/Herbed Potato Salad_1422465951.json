Vegan and egg free.","ingredients":["2 pounds small red potatoes, scrubbed and sliced into ¼-inch thick rounds","1 tablespoon fine sea salt","¼ cup olive oil","⅓ cup lightly packed fresh flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped, plus about 2 tablespoons more for garnish","⅓ cup roughly chopped green onions, plus about 2 tablespoons thinly sliced for garnish","2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice","2 teaspoons Dijon mustard","2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped","Freshly ground black pepper, to taste","3 stalks celery, chopped"],"instructions":"In a large saucepan or Dutch oven combine sliced potatoes and salt. Cover with water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and cook until potatoes are easily pierced by a paring knife and pulled out with little resistance, about 5 to 6 minutes. Reserve ¼ cup cooking water, then drain. Transfer the potatoes to a large mixing bowl. In a small food processor or blender, combine the olive oil, ⅓ cup parsley, ⅓ cup green onions, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, garlic and freshly ground black pepper. Process until the herbs and garlic have been chopped into little pieces. Then, while running the food processor, pour in the reserved cooking water and process just until blended. (If you don’t have a food processor or blender, just finely chop the parsley and onions and whisk the dressing together until the oil is fully incorporated.) Drizzle the potatoes with the herbed olive oil mixture and gently mix to combine. (It will look like you’ve poured in too much dressing, but don’t worry, the potatoes will soak it up!) Let the potatoes rest for ten minutes, gently tossing every few minutes. Add the celery to the bowl, along with a couple tablespoons each of additional chopped parsley and green onions. Toss again. Season generously to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately, or cover and refrigerate until you’re ready to serve. This salad is best served within a few hours, but will keep in the refrigerator for about three days.","tags":["budget friendly","dairy free","egg free","favorites","Game Day","gluten free","Independence Day","Mediterranean","nut free","recipes","salads","side dishes","soy free","spring","summer","tomato free","vegan"],"time":{"prep":"20 mins","cook":"5 mins","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"25 minutes"},"servings":"6 side servings","image":"https://cookieandkate.com/images/2015/07/herbed-red-potato-salad-recipe-1.jpg"}
