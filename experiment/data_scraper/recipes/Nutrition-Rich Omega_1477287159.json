Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent sticking. In a large bowl, mix together melted coconut oil, coconut sugar, mashed banana, and vanilla and almond extracts until smooth and creamy. Next fold in flaxseed meal, almond flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt and mix until a thick dough forms. Next add in oats and chia seeds and gently fold into the batter until evenly distributed. Lastly fold in blueberries and walnuts. Use a large cookie dough scoop or 1/4 cup to scoop dough onto prepared cookie sheet (We want these to be BIG cookies!). Make sure you tightly pack the dough into a ball before putting it onto the sheet. Gently press the top of the dough down just a little to flatten the tops. Bake for 13-16 minutes until edges begin to turn slightly golden brown. Allow cookies to cool for 15 minutes before removing from pan and transferring to a wire rack to finish cooling. Makes 8 big cookies.","tags":[],"time":{"prep":"10 minutes minutes","cook":"15 minutes minutes","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"25 minutes minutes"},"servings":"8","image":"https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Omega-3-Blueberry-Breakfast-Cookies-4long.jpg"}
