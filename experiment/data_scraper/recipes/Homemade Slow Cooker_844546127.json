The best baked beans recipe that's easily vegetarian!","ingredients":["8 ounces uncooked bacon, diced","1 yellow onion, diced","3 cloves garlic, minced","1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans, rinsed and drained","1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained","1 (15 ounce) can northern white beans, rinsed and drained","½ cup ketchup","¼ cup molasses","¼ cup spicy bbq sauce (or your favorite bbq sauce -- use a sweet one if you like sweeter baked beans)","½ cup packed dark brown sugar (or sub coconut sugar)","1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce","½ tablespoon yellow mustard (or sub dijon)"],"instructions":"Cook your bacon: add diced bacon to a large skillet or pan and place over medium heat, cook bacon until crispy and golden brown. If the pan starts to smoke at any point, simply lower the heat. I always cook my bacon on medium low heat. Once bacon is done, blot with a paper towel to absorb excess grease. Allow bacon to cool. Drain the bacon grease, leaving a little on the bottom of the pan and add in the diced onion, cooking for 5-8 minutes or until they are slightly golden. During the last minute of cooking, add in your garlic and cook for 1 min. Remove from heat and set aside. Add the drained and rinsed pinto, kidney and northern beans to the slow cooker, then add in the bacon and onion/garlic. Next add in the ketchup, molasses, bbq sauce, brown sugar, worcestershire and yellow mustard. Stir with a wooden spoon until everything is well combined. Cook on high for 3-4 hours or low for 6-7 hours.","tags":[],"time":{"prep":"30 minutes minutes","cook":"3 hours hours","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"3 hours30 minutes hoursminutes"},"servings":"10","image":"https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beans-FB.png"}
