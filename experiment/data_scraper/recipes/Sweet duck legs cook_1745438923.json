To really get the flavours going, you could keep this in your fridge to marinate for up to 2 days. Then get yourself a pan, casserole or high-sided roasting tray that snugly fits the duck legs. Place the chillies, plums and sugar in the bottom of the tray and then pour the marinade from the bag over the top. Mix it all up using your fingers, and place the duck legs on top. Place the tray in a preheated oven at 170°C/325°F/gas 3 for 2 to 2½ hours until the meat falls away from the bone. Remove the star anise and cinnamon stick, then taste the sauce to see if it needs to be seasoned with a little more soy sauce. It’s now down to you how you would like to serve it. You could have it as a starter with some of the little Chinese pancakes that you can buy, or served simply with rice or noodles and the chunky, jammy plum sauce that the duck has cooked in.","tags":["Jamie's Dinners","Dinner Party","Sunday lunch","Fruit","Mains"],"time":{"prep":"","cook":"Time 2 hours 35 minutes plus marinating time","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"Time 2 hours 35 minutes plus marinating time"},"servings":"Serves 4","image":"https://cdn.jamieoliver.com/recipe-database/medium/106350476.jpg"}
