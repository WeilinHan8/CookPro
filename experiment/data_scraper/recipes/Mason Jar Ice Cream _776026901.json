{"name":"Mason Jar Ice Cream Recipe","description":"No ice cream machine? No problem! Mason jar ice cream is the easiest, fastest way to make the exact kind of ice cream you want.","ingredients":["1 cup heavy cream","1 to 2 tablespoons granulated sugar","1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, or paste","1/4 teaspoon salt","Crushed cookies, optional","Fruit, optional","Flavored extracts, optional","Caramel sauce, optional","Chocolate sauce, optional","Fruit syrup, optional"],"instructions":"Gather the ingredients. Pour the heavy cream, sugar, vanilla, and salt into a pint-sized Mason jar. Add in flavorings (crushed cookies, flavored extract, fruit) if using. Screw on the cap and shake for 3 to 4 minutes or until doubled in volume. Don't overdo it or you'll get whipped creamâ€”the mixture should thickly coat the back of a spoon. Transfer the jar to the freezer and freeze for 2 to 3 hours or until soft-serve consistency (but no longer than that, or it will form ice crystals and be hard to scoop). If you're adding a swirl, remove the jar halfway through freezing (or whenever it's frozen enough to support a chopstick or wooden spoon handle upright), and pour in however much swirl ingredient you'd like. Use the chopstick or spoon handle to swirl it through, then return to freezer until frozen to soft-serve consistency. Enjoy!","tags":["ice cream","desserts","easy desserts","frozen desserts"],"time":{"prep":"3 hrs","cook":"0 mins","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"3 hrs"},"servings":"2 servings","image":"https://www.thespruceeats.com/thmb/IKVYJN9vbhWC3aOECtMMLjCR7XU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mason-jar-ice-cream-04845695-hero-01-d92205b5220042aabc2d98ac942d941e.jpg"}
