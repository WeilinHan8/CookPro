{"name":"Mixed Berry Crisp (Gluten Free)","description":"This delightful berry crisp recipe is the perfect summer dessert. Make it with strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and/or blackberries. It's gluten free!","ingredients":["Mixed berry filling","2 pounds (32 ounces, about 5 cups) mixed berries, fresh or frozen*","⅓ cup honey or maple syrup","2 tablespoons arrowroot starch or 3 tablespoons cornstarch","½ teaspoon orange or lemon zest (if you don’t love strong citrus flavor, scale back to ¼ teaspoon, or omit)","2 tablespoons orange or lemon juice","Gluten-free oat and almond topping","1 cup old-fashioned oats**","½ cup packed almond flour or almond meal","½ cup sliced almonds or chopped pistachios or pecans (optional)","⅓ cup packed coconut sugar or brown sugar","¼ teaspoon fine salt","4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted","3 tablespoons plain yogurt (Greek or regular), or additional melted butter","Plus vanilla ice cream, for serving"],"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Rinse and drain the berries and pick through to remove any stems still attached. If you’re using strawberries, slice them into ¼-inch thick pieces. If you’re using particularly large blackberries, slice them in half. In a 9 by 9-inch baking dish, mix together the berries, honey, starch, citrus zest and juice. Set aside. In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the oats, almond meal/flour, sliced almonds (if using), sugar and salt. Mix in the butter and yogurt. Stir until all of the flour is incorporated and the mixture is moistened throughout. Dollop spoonfuls of the oat mixture over the filling and use your fingers to break up the mixture until it is evenly distributed (no need to pack it down). Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the filling is actively bubbling around the edges and the top is lightly golden. Let the crisp rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Serve with vanilla ice cream (I insist!).","tags":["dessert","egg free","gluten free","Independence Day","naturally sweetened","recipes","soy free","summer","tomato free"],"time":{"prep":"15 minutes","cook":"40 minutes","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"55 minutes"},"servings":"8 servings","image":"https://cookieandkate.com/images/2020/07/mixed-berry-crisp-with-serving-spoon.jpg"}
