{"name":"Rainbow Grilled Cheese Sandwich","description":"Discover how to make a beautiful rainbow grilled cheese sandwich by simply adding food coloring to your cheese of choice.","ingredients":["2 slices bread","1/3 cup shredded white cheese","1 package neon food coloring","1 tablespoon salted butter"],"instructions":"Gather the ingredients. Divide cheese evenly between 4 bowls. Add a squirt of food coloring to 1 bowl and stir it with a fork until coated and colorful. Repeat this step, using different colors, for each of the other bowls until you have your desired colors. Feel free to go a little wild here and combine colors that are analogous to each other. Add colored cheese to piece of bread, in the form of individual lines so that the colors aren't overlapping. This will create the desired rainbow effect. Once the lines of colored cheese take up the entire surface of the bread, add the other piece of bread on top, close sandwich, and butter the outside. In a medium-sized pan, add buttered grilled cheese and cook for a few minutes until bread turns a golden brown and all the cheese has begun to melt. Flip sandwich and repeat until both sides are golden brown and all the cheese has melted. Remove from heat, cut against your original cheese lines, and serve.","tags":["Grilled Cheese","lunch","american","birthdays"],"time":{"prep":"15 mins","cook":"12 mins","active":"","inactive":"","ready":"","total":"27 mins"},"servings":"","image":"https://www.thespruceeats.com/thmb/us-aUrQz-1cvNKJM8k5fmPxaMQ0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rainbow-grilled-cheese-sandwich-4043983-hero-01-f379c617d64f46a684403f116c208131.jpg"}
